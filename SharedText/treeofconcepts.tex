Terminology: By  the generic term \term{tree} is meant a partially ordered set (poset) $(T, <)$ such that for each $t \in T$, the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$ is well-ordered by the relation $<$.
In this discussion we restrict ourselves to \highlight{rooted $\omega$-trees} i.e. trees for which the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$
is finite for all $t \in T$ and for which there is a unique element $t$ such that
 the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$ is empty. We say that such a $t$ is the root of the tree.

With respect to a partial ordering $<$, we say that \highlight{an element $y$ \textit{covers}  an element $x$} in  iff $x<y$ and there does not exist $w$ such that $x < w$ and $w < y$.
If object $y$ covers object $x$ in the partial ordering 
then we write \highlight{$x \base y$} (we use this in preference to the more usual $x \lessdot y$).
For $x$ an element of the tree we define the set of elements  \highlight{$Cover(x)$} to be the set of objects covering $x$.

Such trees as these we can equivalently describe as models of the generalised algebraic theory given below table \ref{GATOFTREES} in which the nodes of height $n+1$ are represented as of a sort $Cover_{n+1}$that is dependent on the sort of nodes of height $n$.

There is a  shorthand that is convenient in the presentation  of the GAT of trees  and then subsequently in the GAT of contextual categories. We use the shorthand
$\ofTn{x}{n}{\genericOb}$ for the context $\ofS{x_0},\ofSi{x_1}{1}{x_0}, \hdots \ofSi{x_n}{n}{x_0,x_1,\hdots x_{n-1}} $. \\

\noindent Using this shorthand, for any $n \geq 0$ the sort $Cover_{n}$  in the theory of trees is introduced as follows: \\

\begin{tabular}{>{\itshape}l l}
Symbol & \itshape{Introductory Rule} \\
$\Sz  $     & $\isT{\Sz}$\\
$\Si{n+1}, n \geq 0 $ & $\ofTn{x}{n}{\genericOb}    \tstyle \isT{\Si{n+1}(\bar{x})} $\\
\end{tabular} \\
