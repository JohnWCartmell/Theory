\subsection {An Aside on Recursive Type Definitions}

Using the shorthand, we are quite close to having a recursive definition of a single sort $Cover$.
Such definitions are not possible in generalised algebraic theories but we can imagine a framework in which it is possible to write: \\
\vspace{0.03cm} 
\begin{tabular}{>{\itshape}l l}
Symbol & \itshape{Introductory Rule} \\
$Base $     & $\isT{Base}$\\
$Cover  $     & $\ofT{x_0}{Base}    \tstyle \isT{Cover(x_0)} $\\
$Cover $      & $\ofT{x}{Cover}    \tstyle \isT{Cover(x)} $\\
\end{tabular} \\
\vspace{.1cm}  \\

Such a definition could be represented algebraically in a suitably generalised notion of contextual category (a comulti-contextual category?) these dependencies could be represented
as follows:  

\begin{center}
$
\begin{array}{c c}
\Rnode{abs}{1}  \\ [1.4cm]
\Rnode{S0}{Base} \\ [1.4cm]
\Rnode{SR}{Cover} \\ [1.4cm]
\end{array}
$
\ncsar{S0}{abs}
\ncsar{SR}{S0}
\ncrsar{SR}{SR}
\end{center}

\noindent This is not just an idle thought -- in  data modelling such a tree 
structure is represented in an entity model diagram in which the injections into the coproduct $Ob$ of $Base$ and $Cover$ are represented by containment: \\
