a claim that normalisation isn't required to get normal form from an ERD diagram

4.1.3 3NF Relations Versus Entity-Relationship Relations. From the definition
of “relation,” any grouping of domains can be considered to be a relation. To avoid
undesirable properties in maintaining relations, a normalization process is proposed
to transform arbitrary relations into the first normal form, then into the second
normal form, and finally into the third normal form (3NF) [9, 111. We shall
show that the entity and relationship relations in the entity-relationship model
are similar to 3NF relations but with clearer semantics and without using the
transformation operation.
