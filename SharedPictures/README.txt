These tex files have been copied from a release of ERScript - source consists of xml files in ERScript.

tex files in the latex folder were built by
- creating a folder called temp
- changing directory into the temp folder
- creating a temp subfolder
- then
    powershell ..\..\..\..\Scripting\ERScript_r4\commands\quickbuild.ps1 -l -tex performanceOfPlayCompositional.xml
	
	
Alternatively tex could be copied from a suitable build of ERmodel - I did have one because this was a newkly created example.
