\section{Communicating Relationships}


\subsection{Recap}
\mynote
Earlier, in section \ref{sub:conveying_facts_and_storing_of_data}, we looked at examples of the use
of references to entitites, and thereby referentials,  
to convey instances of relationships.  
On the surface of it it is very simple ---
to convey instances of relationships we reference two entities and assert a relationship between them
as in this example:

\begin{equation}
\label{JupiterIoPernickity}
\mbox{\textit{The planet \rdash{Jupiter} 
\uwave{is orbited} by the moon \rdot{Io}}}
\end{equation}

in which a single referential references one entity, a second referential references a second entity
and a relationship instance is asserted.  
In this simple example each of these references to entities contains  a single referential 
but we have already seen examples where multiple referentials are required to reference an entity. For example
\begin{itemize}
\item Hot Springs, Arkansas;
\item the route from Hot Springs, Arkansas to Jacksonville, Alabahma;
\item the conjunction of Mars and Jupiter on July 4, 929;
\item Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night (i.e. the play Twelfth Night by playwright William Shakespeare);
\item Touchstone from Shakespeare’s As You Like It;
\item the role of Touchstone in the production of Shakespeare’s As You Like It
performed April – May 1975, at Oxford Playhouse.
\end{itemize}

We have seen also how in some references, for example the final one in the list above,  there are less referentials than is implied by a simple sum of the parts  and that this is because of overlaps (for which we used the term collapsed referentials) and that these overlaps come about because of the equivalence of comparable paths of identifying relationships.

For example an instance of a dramatic role being played by an actor might be commmunicated as follows:
\begin{erquote}
\parbox{8.7cm}{\linespread{1.5}\normalsize the role of \rdot{Touchstone} in the production of \mbox{\rdot{Shakespeare}'s} \\
 \rdot{As You Like It} performed \mbox{\rdot{April – May 1975},} at \\
\rdot{Oxford Playhouse} was \uwave{played by} \rdash{Bob Hoskins},
}
\end{erquote}
which, by the way, is a true fact. 
In this example, referentials to reference the dramatic role are dotted underlined --- there are five of them.
 The relationship is wavy underlined. Referentials to reference the actor are dash underlined   --- there is only one of them.
 The relationship being instanced is this one
\begin{equation}
\scalebox{0.9}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsPlayedByRelationship..diagram.tex}}
\end{equation}
which was described earlier in figure \ref{dramaticArts1..diagram}.

\subsection{What More is to be Said}
\mynote
We see that whenever a relationship instance is to be conveyed two sets of referentials are required --- one to reference the first entity and the other to reference the second entity.  
\mynote
Now we have to consider the possibility that sometimes, \textit{a priori}, these two sets of referentials overlap. 
In other words that, \textit{a priori}, some of the referentials for the two distinct entities coincide.
Shlaer and Long, in a very much underrated paper, 
explore this topic in the context of relational database structure and refer to the then shared coincident referential as a \textit{collapsed referential}. 
\mynote
We look at cases where there are collapsed referentials, and also at some other cases which exhibit different characteristics by which 
referentials that one might expect to be present are simply not needed --- in such cases we shall 
adapt the coinage of Shlaer and Long and say that there are \textit{absent referentials}.
Just as we saw in the previous section, we see different characteristics\commentary{better word than behaviour} emerge\commentary{exhibited?} in the presence of comparable paths of relationships
which are either equivalent or near equivalent.
\begin{notebox}
I have checked whether Shlaer \& Lang describe the variant of the student professor model in which student $\morph$ department is not identifying for this will be a case of absent referentials. Thy do not!!!!! 
\end{notebox}
\mynote
This is an important topic that requires careful artriculation
and without knowledge of this topic one has not a full understanding
of data both as it is conveyed in common langauge and as it is communicated and stored in information systems.

\subsection{An Example in which Referentials Collapse}
\mynote 
To illustrate the discussion that follows, 
imagine we model the plots of plays and in doing so consider \commentary{globalise this somehow, summarise/compare the plots of many plays}
love, reciprocated or not, to be a many-many relationship between characters like so
\begin{equation}
\label{dramaticArtsLoves..relationship}
\scalebox{0.9}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsLoves..relationship..diagram.tex}}
\end{equation}
and consider how instances of this relationship might properly be conveyed.
\mynote
As we have said above, and according to the model we have assumed (see figure \ref{dramaticArts1..diagram}),
  characters from plays need be identified by three referentials
 --- the name of the character, the title of the play and the name of the playwright.
With this being so, it naively implies that 
if we wish to communicate an instance of the relationship, 
(\ref{dramaticArtsLoves..relationship}), 
then we will be required to communicate six referentials
 -- three to identify one party in the relationship and three to identify the other party;
so, if I follow this approach, I would convey a particular relationship instance like this:
\begin{equation}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{The character named Antonio in Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night loves the character named Sebastian in Shakespeare play Twelfth Night.}}}
\end{equation} 
But there is a reason why the shorter
\begin{equation}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{The character named Antonio in Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night loves the character named Sebastian.}}}
\end{equation} 
is correct and it is  important we can understannd and articulate this reason.

The reason is because the relationship `loves' in this context 
is, \textit{a priori}, a relationship which is internal to the plot of a single individual play ---
it is an intra-play relationship rather than an inter-play relationship.
Because it is intra-play, when we convey an instance then the referentials that refer to the play are shared between lover and loved As shown in figure \ref{SebastianLovesAntonio}. The title of the play ad the name of the playwright are coincident. 

\begin{erboxedFigure}{H}{SebastianLovesAntonio}
{Referencing two different characters using just four referentials. This is an example of what Shlaer and Lang (?) called collapsed referentials. What we see is that referential `Shakespeare' contributes to two different references. Likewise does the referential `Twelfth Night'.
These are examples of shared referentals --- they contribute, as indicated, to both reference 1 and reference 2. The naive requirement for six referentials collapses to there being four.}

\newcommand{\dashRelationship}{1pt 0pt}
\newcommand{\dashRefTwo}{1pt 1pt}

\syntag{\dashRefOne}{ref1}{0.9}{w2}{-0.2}
\syntag{\dashRefOne}{ref1}{0.9}{w3}{-0.2}
\syntag{\dashRelationship}{rel} {0.7} {w4}{0}
\syntag{\dashRefTwo}{ref2}{0.4}{w2}{0.2}
\syntag{\dashRefTwo}{ref2}{0.4}{w3}{0.3}
\syntag{\dashRefTwo}{ref2}{0.4}{w5}{0}
\end{tabular}
\end{erboxedFigure}

An instances of the `loves' relationship is conveyed by a total of four referentials
 not the six that might have been required
if the relationship were global in scope as would have been the case if a
 character from one play could love a character from an entirely different play.

\mynote 
Now we need to drill into this statement made above that `the loves relationship is intra-play rather than inter-play'. What that means is that whenever one character loves another character then the loved character is a character in the same play as the lover character.  We can say that more concisely in symbols
if we label the relationship between lover and loved as `r' and if we label the relationship between a character and the play  they are a character within as `d1'
then 
\begin{equation}
r \circ d1 \leq d1
\end{equation}

which is used as a shorthand for saying
\begin{quote}
for all instances x and y of type character such that $y \in r(x)$,
\begin{equation*}
d(x) = d(y)
\end{equation*}  
\end{quote}
In the sense given earlier the following triangle of relationships(in which d1 is depicted twice over)  is near-commutative
 \begin{equation*}
\scalebox{0.9}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsLoves..scopeTriangle..diagram.tex}}
\end{equation*}

I shall say that this diagram provides the scope for relationship (\ref{dramaticArtsLoves..relationship}). 

We can reinforce what was said earlier, equivalent and near-equivalent paths
have  a bearing on how instances are communicated and for this reason it is important 
that they are documented in entity models. Without knowledge of these equivalences,
we cannot infer from the model how relationship instances can properly be communicated 
i.e. how communicated in a way that avoids redundancy of information,
nor can we tell, for that matter, how they can be best represented in data.  

We can reinforce the earlier point that equivalent and near-equivalent paths significantly impact how instances are communicated. For this reason, it is crucial to document them in entity models. Without an understanding of these equivalences, we cannot determine from the model how relationship instances should be communicated in a way that avoids redundancy. Moreover, we cannot establish how they should be optimally represented in data.


 \subsection{Referentials That Do Not Collapse Though They Could}
 An example of a relationship between characters that is global in scope 
 is the relationship of one character being modelled on or resembling or being inspired 
 by another character from the dramatic arts.
 To convey an instance of this relationship, being as the relationship is global in scope,  does indeed require
 six referentials --- three for the one party and three for the other --- as in this example:
\begin{erquote}
\parbox{9.0cm}{\linespread{1.3}\normalsize
\rdash{Romeo} from \rdash{Shakespeare}'s \rdash{Romeo and Juliet}
          \uwave{is modelled on} \rdot{Pyramus} from \rdot{Ovid}'s \rdot{Metamorphoses}.}
\end{erquote}
which, interpreted from the perspective of the dramatic arts that we have given above, does indeed contain six referentials. 
The first three, shown with dashed underlining, reference one character.
The verb of the sentence is the name of the relationship, and, 
the final three referentials, with dotted underlining, 
reference a second character from a different play.\footnote{I am bending the facts a bit here 
in that Metamophoses isn't strictly a play - its a bunch of stories.} 
There are no shared referentials.
