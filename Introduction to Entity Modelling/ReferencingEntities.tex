\section{Referencing Entities}
\label{ReferencingEntities}

In this section we explore the significance of the identifying features
of a type and the manner in which knowledge of these features enables us to 
reference entities and, in turn, to convey, communicate and store instances of relationships. 
There is more to this than initially meets the eye and we explore the topic
by way of examples. 

\subsection{The Simplest Case --- Planets and their Moons as Named Entities}
\mynote
In the simplest examples entities of a type have names associated with them and these are unique and can be  quoted to reference entities of the type. 
Name attributes in these cases are archetypal examples of identifying attributes. 

We have already seen an example of the role of the naming of both planets and moons in the example given earlier for a phraseology for the communication of relationships
 in which we presented this statement:
\begin{equation}
\label{JupiterIoShort}
\mbox{\textit{Jupiter is orbited by Io.}}
\end{equation}
as a representation of an instance of the binary relationship
\begin{gather}
\label{planetMoonSecondInstance}
\raisebox{-1cm}{
\input{\ImagesFolder/planetMoon.tex}
}
\end{gather}
for in the context of statement (\ref{JupiterIoShort}), Jupiter is the name of, and therefore  a reference to, a planet and  Io is the name of, and therefore a reference to, a moon i.e. a natural satellite.\footnote{
Note that within the context of the solar system the name Io  doesn't uniquely identify this moon of Jupiter amongst all named solar system objects since it is also the name of an asteroid that orbits within the asteroid belt.
The names of moons are only unique as names of moons. 
Of course in other contexts, both Jupiter and Io are the names of mythological figures.
} 
We understand  (\ref{JupiterIoShort}), therefore, to be shorthand for the 
more pernickerty 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{\textit{The planet with name `Jupiter' is orbited by the moon with name `Io'.}}
\end{equation}

\mynote So planets and moons are named which is to say they have name attributes.
\commentary{Rewrite this paragraph.}
Of course name attributes are archetypal examples of identifying attributes --- we name things so that we can identify them in context. In such a situation the name of an entity, i.e. the value of the name attribute,  can be used in context to definitively identify the entity.
Quoting this value, i.e. using the name, is one way of referencing an entity of the type from within the context of another.
 \mynote
Focusing on just this aspect of the solar system we  draw the model shown in figure
\ref{planetMoonModel}
containing the relationship (\ref{planetMoonSecondInstance}) and showing name attributes of both moons and planets and
underlining these to showing that each of them is unique and therefore identifying. 
This is the entity model (albeit of a very small universe) that explains the communication (\ref{JupiterIoShort}) or equally, and as we shall see later, the structure of the data table of planets and moons given earlier.
\begin{erboxedFigure} {H}{planetMoonModel}
{
caption blah blah blah
 }
\input{\ImagesFolder/planetMoonModel.tex}
\end{erboxedFigure}
\mynote
We are very much stating the obvious of course but there is a pattern here and it is repeated over and over when instances of relationships are communicated  and the same pattern occurs more formally  and uniformly when instances of relationships are communicated in software systems and/or stored in data.

\begin{noteforfuture}
would like an example with two or three identifying attributes but --- cannot think of one. The ones I have given earlier are not very convincing.
\end{noteforfuture}

\subsection{Context and the Referencing of Entities}
\mynote
This section is about the way that entities may be referenced using identifying features
 when one these features is a relationship.
We look at how,  in this situation, the referencing 
--- the nature of the reference ---   
is impacted by the context within which the reference is being made. 
We see the reference as a phrase quoting the values of identifying attributes
and that the number quoted as depending on 
the context within which the reference is made.
What we see contributes later to the analysis of how 
instances of a relationship can be conveyed, communicated or stored and
how this is affected by shared knowledge we might have about 
the scope of  the relationship.\footnote{Speak of scope beforehand because need to keep interest in what seems not interesting. Add footnote about scope at first use (here?). Probably explain scope in next section because scope affects everything not just ``data''.} \footnote{if explained before could here say ``Here is that scope concept again. Explanation comes in next section.''}

\mynote
 We use as an example the referencing of characters from  plays
 within the context of  the  dramatic arts  as modelled earlier in figure xxx.
Since there are only a few specific details of figure xxx --- three in fact ---
that concern us here we pull these out as details  (a), (b) and (c) in
figure \ref{dramaticArtsIdentificationDetails} . 
%\vspace{-0.2cm} % Dont know why I need this but I do.
\begin{erboxedFigure}{H}{dramaticArtsIdentificationDetails}
{Details from the model of the dramatic arts that was presented in figure xxx.
(a), (b) and (c) show the identifying features of, respectively, types character, play and playwright. 
}
\vspace{-0.7cm}% Dont know why I need this but I do.
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
(a) 
\raisebox{-1.5cm}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsPlayCharacterDetail.tex}}
 && (b) \kern-0.35cm
\raisebox{-1.5cm}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsPlaywrightPlayDetail.tex}}
 &&  (c) 
\raisebox{-1.5cm}{\input{\ImagesFolder/dramaticArtsAbsolutePlaywrightDetail.tex}}
\end{tabular}
\end{erboxedFigure}

\mynote 
Detail (a) can be paraphrased as: 
\begin{equation}
\label{characterReferenceFromPlay}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{within the context of a play, a character within it can be referenced by name}}}\\
\end{equation}

\begin{exerciseforreader}
With a minor exception there is a standard phraseology in use here. Exercise for the reader What exception is being used and how might this be accounted for? 
\end{exerciseforreader}

For instance in a stage direction such as:  
\begin{equation*}
\text{\textit{Enter Sebastian.}}
\end{equation*}
we are soundly rooted in the context of a play in this case in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, say. 
Though the name of the character isn't unique, not so even in the plays of Shakespeare, the name alone suffices.
A single identifying attribute suffices.
This is the simplest of observations
but it is worth drawing attention to it  
because it is an an example of a phenomenon  that is significant
and impactful on the way that 
relationships are conveyed, communicated and stored.
Examples like this will be used to illuminate a  mechanism frequently found at work in the
structuring of data.
 
\mynote %50
Both of the the details (b) and (c) can be paraphrased likewise but
on the other hand, details (a) and (b) taken together imply: 
\begin{equation}
\label{characterReferenceFromPlaywright}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{within the context of a playwright
(say in a discussion of the works of a playwright), 
a character within the works of the playwright 
can be referenced by the title of a play 
and a name of a character within that play. }}}\\
\end{equation}
So in answer to a question``Who is the Shakespeare character who is a twin brother and is believed lost at sea?''
someone might answer with 
\begin{equation*}
\label{antonioReferenceFromPlaywright}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{Sebastian from Twelfth Night. }}}\\
\end{equation*}
using both name of the character and title of the play in accordance with (\ref{characterReferenceFromPlaywright}).
\mynote 
Likewise, from (a), (b) and (c) taken together we have that
\begin{equation} 
\label{absoluteCharacterReferencing}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{without context, a character within a play 
may be referenced by the name of character, the title of a play and the name of the playwright who wrote the play.}}}
\end{equation}
so in answer to the question ``who is the linguist character who teaches diction and manners to a flower girl?''
 then the answer might be the name of a character, the title of a play and the name of the author as in 
 \begin{equation*}
\label{HenryHigginsReferenceFromAbsolute}
\text{\parbox{9cm}{\textit{Henry Higgins from Shakespeare's Pygmalion. }}}\\
\end{equation*}
in accordance with (\ref{absoluteCharacterReferencing}).

\subsection{When communicating a plurarity of instances of relationships is less that the sum of the parts }
\subsection{Philosophy}
We think particulars --- entities and relationships --- but we speak universals.

Three universals to reference a character. Name of playwright, title of play, name of character.

\subsection{Somewhere}
\mynote
referential attributes represent data not concept.
\commentary{maybe in a new subsection on cascading identifiers}
\mynote
relationships model concept and context not data. 


 
\subsection{communicating relationships}
\begin{newtt}
\mynote 
So we have, in the context of the plays of William Shakespeare,
\begin{equation}
\label{AntonioLovesSebastian}
\mbox{\textit{The character Antonio in Twelfth Night loves Sebastian.}}
\end{equation} 
\end{newtt}
