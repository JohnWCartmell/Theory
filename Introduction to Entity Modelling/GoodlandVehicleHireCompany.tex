This example is developed and elaborated on throughout the book as an example of how a computer system may be analysed, documented, respecified and extended with the goal of better supporting business.

Figure 3.35, from Goodland and Slater SSADM book page 106. See also fig. 4.13, pg 159 and fig 4.58 page 213.
Consider simplifying and having a many-many betwixt payment and booking. 
Later will have a version as in the book with allocated payment as an intersection entity. 
Can we avoid needing bars on relationships in this way?
