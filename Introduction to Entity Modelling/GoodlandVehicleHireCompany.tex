\section{Example --- Goodland Vehicle Hire Company}
\label{GoodlandVehicleHireCompany}

\mynote As a further example in figure \ref{SSADMCarHireExample}  I have reproduced an example from a book on SSADM\footnote{SSADM is an acronym for Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology.} by Goodland and Slater. It is, say the authors, a diagram specifying the logical data structure underlying the business operations of a hypothetical vehicle rental company that leases vans and trucks, and sometimes drivers, to its customers. 
\mynote
The example is developed and further elaborated at different points in the SSADM book as part of an extended example
of how to document, analyse, specify and support improved business systems. 

\mynote Hyopthetically this company has many local offices and both drivers and vehicles are based at local offices. \commentary{improvise some text to go with this as a series of independent mynotes}

Figure 3.35, from Goodland and Slater SSADM book page 106. See also fig. 4.13, pg 159 and fig 4.58 page 213.
Consider simplifying and having a many-many betwixt payment and booking. 
Later will have a version as in the book with allocated payment as an intersection entity. 
Can we avoid needing bars on relationships in this way?
