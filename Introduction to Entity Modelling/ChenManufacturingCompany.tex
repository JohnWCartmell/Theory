\section{Example --- Chen Manufacturing Company}
\label{ChenManufacturingCompany}
In figure \ref{ChenManufacturingExample} I have reproduced an example entity relationship diagram  given in Chen's 1976 paper. This example documents principle types of entity in the organisation of an imaginary manufacturing company.  I wanted to redraw
this diagram in the Barker-Ellis style used in this book. To do this I needed to make some educated guesses about the meaning of some of Chen's relationships since use of the Barker-Ellis style  required me to descriptively label the relationships. Having made these guesses I drew the diagram shown
 in figure \ref{chenManufacturingCo..diagram}. 

\begin{erboxedFigure} {H}{ChenManufacturingExample}{
In effect this is the first ever entity relationship diagram. It is an entity relationship diagram in the Chen style from his seminal paper of 1976 and it is there described as being an analysis of information in a manufacturing firm. In this diagram
diamonds represent what we describe here as relationships and boxes represent types of entities.  
For completeness we should mention that in Chen's 1976 terminology the boxes were said to be entity sets and the diamonds were said to be relationship sets but by 1983 in a paper published in that year Chen is instead using the terms `entity type' and `relationship type'. While sympathising with this terminology we think it correct to to use the term `relationship' rather than 'relationship type' because this brings us closer to the terminology of formal logic.

\begin{erboxedFigure} {H}{chenManufacturingCo..diagram}{
Chen's 1976 entity relationship diagram (shown in figure \ref{ChenManufacturingExample}) 
redrawn as a structured entity model using the Barker-Ellis notation. 
 The rail at the top of the diagram represents the whole of the model which in this case is the manufacturing company in question.
I have had to guess at the meanings of some of Chen's relationships in figure \ref{ChenManufacturingExample}
 in order to label them meaningfully in this diagram. 
Having made my guess I have represented  the ternary relationship in Chen's diagram by type \textit{project supply option} and type \textit{part used on project}. 
I hope that you agree that this Barker-Ellis style diagram leaves less to the imagination than Chen's original diagram did.

As a footnote to figures \ref{ChenManufacturingExample} and \ref{chenManufacturingCo..diagram}, 
note that the  meaning of the term  `part' can itself be itself be a point of confusion ---
does it mean an actual physical part or  a part design?
I found a discussion of the ambiguity of the term  on wikipedia which stated that `part' as something that had a `part number' ususally meant `part design' rather than an instantiation of that design:
\begin{erquote}
As a part number is an identifier of a part design (independent of its instantiations), a serial number is a unique identifier of a particular instantiation of that part design. In other words, a part number identifies any particular (physical) part as being made to that one unique design; a serial number, when used, identifies a particular (physical) part (one physical instance), as differentiated from the next unit that was stamped, machined, or extruded right after it. This distinction is not always clear, as natural language blurs it by typically referring to both part designs, and particular instantiations of those designs, by the same word, ``part(s)''. Thus if you buy a muffler of P/N 12345 today, and another muffler of P/N 12345 next Tuesday, you have bought ``two copies of the same part'', or``two parts'', depending on the sense implied.
