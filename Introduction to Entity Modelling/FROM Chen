a claim that normalisation isn't required to get normal form from an ERD diagram

4.1.3 3NF Relations Versus Entity-Relationship Relations. From the definition
of “relation,” any grouping of domains can be considered to be a relation. To avoid
undesirable properties in maintaining relations, a normalization process is proposed
to transform arbitrary relations into the first normal form, then into the second
normal form, and finally into the third normal form (3NF) [9, 111. We shall
show that the entity and relationship relations in the entity-relationship model
are similar to 3NF relations but with clearer semantics and without using the
transformation operation.

abstract for Chen 1983
In many information system projects, information requirements are initially documented in English, and then database designers convert these English descriptions into database schemas in terms of entity-relationship (ER) diagrams (or other similar representations). This paper studies the correspondence between English sentence structure and ER diagrams, and proposes eleven rules for translation. The basic constructs of English, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, gerund, and clause, are found to have counterparts in the ER diagrammatic technique. Finally, an example is used to demonstrate the applicability of these rules in database design.
