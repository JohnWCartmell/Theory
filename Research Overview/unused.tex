\note It seems to me that in the syntax of gats, \textit{types and terms} on the one hand and \textit{contexts and realisations} on the other are each mutually dependent. In the world 
of syntax neither can exist without the other.

\note 
There now follows an aside relevant to the statement of a  condition for a cwf to be contextual. Consider  Lisp-style lists. These  are often described as algebraic data structures but of course such structures are not algebraic in the precise sense that we mean when we speak of many-sorted algebraic theories or generalised algebraic theories rather they require coproducts of types for their definition. In a type theory that is many-sorted algebraic (or generalised algebraic) augmented by coproducts Lisp-style the type of lists over some other type $A$ can be defined as the coproduct of the types of empty lists $Empty$ and non-empty lists $Cons$
 as follows:\\

\begin{notebox}[Theory of lists of elements of type A]

If the empty list is written as $nil$ and if the LISP list constructor $cons$ is represented
as an infix operator $::$ then the theory of a list of elements of type $A$ can expressed as follows: 
\begin{gatrules}
\gatintros
\gatintro{Empty}{}{\isT{Empty}}   
\gatintro{Cons}{}{\isT{Cons}}     
\gatintro{List}{}{List = Empty + Cons} 
\gatintro{nil}{}{\ofT{nil}{Empty}}    
\gatintro{::}{\ofT{x}{A},\ \ofT{l}{List}}{\ofT{x::l}{List}}
\gatintro{hd}{\ofT{l}{Cons}}{\ofT{hd(l)}{A}} 
\gatintro{tl}{\ofT{l}{Cons}}{\ofT{tl(l)}{List}}   
\gataxioms
\gataxiom{e=nil}{\ofT{e}{Empty}}                            
\gataxiom{hd(x::l)=x}{\ofT{l}{List},\  \ofT{x}{A}}         
\gataxiom{tl(x::l)=l}{\ofT{l}{List},\  \ofT{x}{A}}        
\gataxiom{hd(l)::tl(l)=l}{\ofT{l}{Cons}} 
\end{gatrules}
Expressed as sketch of a category we have a coproduct diagram
expressing $List = Empty + Cons$,
a product diagram expressing the product $A \times List$,
additional morphisms:
$nil: 1 \morph Empty$,
$cons : A \times List \morph Cons$,
$hd: Cons \morph A$ and
$tl: Cons \morph List$.

and identities (commuting diagrams) expressing that
morphisms $nil: 1 \morph Empty$ and $cons : A \times List \morph Cons$ are isomorphims 
with inverses, respectively, of the unique morphism $t_{Empty}: Empty \morph 1$
and the morphism $\tuple{hd,tl}:Cons \morph A \times List$.
