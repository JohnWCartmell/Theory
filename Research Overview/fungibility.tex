\note \commentary{added 24 April 2021} I am going to say that two theories are fungible\footnote{I am using this word (which I learnt from Ian Stewart) so as to avoid use of the word `equivalent' at this point.} when one is just as good as the other for a purpose at hand.
\note 
Are the theories of meta-gat algebras, contextual categories and contextual categories with families fungible? Is one of these better than the the others? I have in the past been of the opinion that all three are fungible and but also that there is a primacy of the  first over the second over the third and this because the second and third fall foul of Occam's razor and multiply entitites needlessly.  Recently I have become unsure that these three theories are fungible -- it depends, of course, on what the purpose at hand is.
\note
To investigate what we might mean by fungible consider generalised algebraic theories $U_1$ :
\begin{equation*}
\label{tmorphism}
\begin{array}{c}
\isT{A} \\
\isT{B} \\
\ofT{y}{B} \tstyle \ofT{f(y)}{A}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
and $U_2$ :
\begin{equation*}
\label{tfamily}
\begin{array}{c}
\isT{A} \\
\ofT{x}{A} \tstyle \isT{B(x)} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item the categories $U_1$-alg and $U_2$-alg  are equivalent,
\item 
 with respect to a contextual category \catcw, the category of internal $U_1$ structures and the category of internal  $U_2$ structures will not necessarily be equivalent 
\item however if contextual category  
\catcw has a $\Sigma$-structure and has strong identity types, as has $\Fam$, then these two categories of internal structures
are equivalent.
\end{itemize}  

This comes about because:
\begin{itemize}
\item  the two theories are not isomorphic in the category of generalised algebraic theories, 
\item  the theories are isomorphic in the category of  generalised algebraic theories enriched with $\Sigma$ \commentary{caveat}
and strong identity types.
\end{itemize}
\note I have been guilty of double think in the past. I have always instinctively felt that $U_1$ and
$U_2$ were not fungible but that theories of contextual categories and meta-gat algebras were fungible.
Both cannot be true.

\note Another example concerns categories with finite products and cartesian multi-categories. These are fungible if the purpose at hand is to look at such structures in (internal to) $\Fam$ but
not so if the purpose is to look at such structures internal to  more general contextual categories. 

\note The conclusion of this afterthought is that it would be improper for foundations to start with contextual categories
(or C-systems, or contextual categories with families). If a foundation is to start with any such thing it should start with 
meta-gat algebras. These may be fungible with  B-systems depending on exactly how B-systems are described.
