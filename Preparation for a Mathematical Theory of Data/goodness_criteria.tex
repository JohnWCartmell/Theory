\subsubsection{The Principle of No Redundancy}
\subsubsection{The Requirement}
\subsubsection{The Principle of Maximal Constrainedness}
Maximum constrainedness, as mentioned above, is a property of the category $\catc$ generated by the presentation  rather than of the presentation itself and is defined  relative to a requirement $\reqtc$ by which we mean a set of 
instances where each instance is a functor $D$, $D: \catc \morph \Fin$. In what follows, therefore,  by a requirement $\reqtc$ for category $\catc$ we mean a set  $\reqtc \subseteq | \Fin^{\catc} |$. 

Consider, a theory usually has some slack by which we mean that it has structurally compliant instances that are not part of its requirement.  The definition of maximal constrainedness expresses that a theory is maximally constrained to its requirement if there is no way of extending the theory so as to rule out possible structurally compliant instances that are not part of the requirement (i.e. to rule out slack) whilst remaining consistent with the requirement.

The definition now follows, preceded by an auxiliary definition.
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a requirement for $\catc$,  if $I: \catc \morph \catcp$ is a functor then say that $I$ is \term{consistent with} requirement $\reqtc$ iff for all instances $D \in \reqtc$ there exists a functor $D':\catcp \morph \Fin$ such that $I \circ D'=D$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a requirement for $\catc$ then $\catc$ is \term{maximally constrained} to the requirement $\reqtc$ iff for all categories $\catcp$ and for all functors $I:\catc \morph \catcp$ that are consistent with $\reqtc$, for all functors $F: \catc \morph \Fin$  there exists an $F' : \catcp \morph \Fin$ such that $I \circ F'=F$.
\end{definition}



\subsubsection{The Principle of the Representation of Functional Dependencys}

}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances and if \fgsourcediag
in $\catc$ then there is a  \term{functional dependency} of $g$ on $f$ with respect to $\reqtc$ iff
there is a family of functions $H_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$ such that 
in each instance $D$, $H_D$ is a unique function $H_D: D(b) \morph D(c)$, such that $D(f) \circ H_D = D(g)$. 
If there is such a functional dependency then we say that $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ in $\catc$ with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{definition}

Our use of the $\morph$ notation for functional dependencies here is coming from relational database theory where it is usual to represent such a functional dependency as we have here by asserting that 
$$
f \morph g
$$
Note that this use of an $\morph$ notation is independent of our use of $\morph$ as a morphism of a category 
or, for that matter, as an edge in a presentation. Neither are we alluding to a bicategory structure. We have two distinct uses for $\morph$ (three if you distinguish arrows in presentations from arrows in categories). Any particular use will be unambiguous in context.

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, if
\fgsourcediag
in $\catc$ 
and if there is a functional dependency $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ then say that 
the functional dependency $H$ is \term{represented} in $\catc$ 
iff there exists a morphism $h:b \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that for each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(h)=H_D$.

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances 
and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$, then a \term{referential inclusion dependency} $I$, written $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$, is a family of functions $I_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$
such that each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $I_D$ is a unique function $I_D : D(a) \morph D(c)$ such that
for each $i$, $1 \leq i \le n$, $I_D \circ D(q_i) = D(f_i)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances and if
\fnsourceqnsource

iff there exists a morphism $i:a \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that in each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(i) = I_D$.
