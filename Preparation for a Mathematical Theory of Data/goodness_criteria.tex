\subsubsection{The Principle of No Redundancy}
If $S$ is a sketch for a category \catcw considered as a data specification with set of instances
$R_C$ then the the sketch $S$ then none of the edges or path equivalences in $S$ should be
redundant i.e. there should be no subsketch of $S$ which is a sketch of \catcw. 

Rationale: Redundant edges lead to redundant data. Redundant diagrams give rise to unnecessary program logic.

Example In the example given above of the sketch for the relational meta model the edge $R_?$ and the path equivalence ??? are redundant. Therefore this is not a 'good' data specification.  
\subsubsection{The Requirement}
\subsubsection{The Principle of Maximal Constrainedness}
Maximum constrainedness, as mentioned above, is a property of the category $\catc$ generated by the presentation  rather than of the presentation itself and is defined  relative to a requirement $\reqtc$ by which we mean a set of 
instances where each instance is a functor $D$, $D: \catc \morph \Fin$. In what follows, therefore,  by a requirement $\reqtc$ for category $\catc$ we mean a set  $\reqtc \subseteq | \Fin^{\catc} |$. 

Consider, a theory usually has some slack by which we mean that it has structurally compliant instances that are not part of its requirement.  The definition of maximal constrainedness expresses that a theory is maximally constrained to its requirement if there is no way of extending the theory so as to rule out possible structurally compliant instances that are not part of the requirement (i.e. to rule out slack) whilst remaining consistent with the requirement.

The definition now follows, preceded by an auxiliary definition.
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a requirement for $\catc$,  if $I: \catc \morph \catcp$ is a functor then say that $I$ is \term{consistent with} requirement $\reqtc$ iff for all instances $D \in \reqtc$ there exists a functor $D':\catcp \morph \Fin$ such that $I \circ D'=D$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a requirement for $\catc$ then $\catc$ is \term{maximally constrained} to the requirement $\reqtc$ iff for all categories $\catcp$ and for all functors $I:\catc \morph \catcp$ that are consistent with $\reqtc$, for all functors $F: \catc \morph \Fin$  there exists an $F' : \catcp \morph \Fin$ such that $I \circ F'=F$.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Goodness Principle 2:}
If \catcw is a category and $R_C$ is a set of instances then \catcw should be maximally constrained to $R_C$.

\end{arrows}
$  
}

\newcommand{\pequiv}[1][R_C]{\underset{#1}{\equiv}}

\begin{definition}
If $\catcw$ is a  category, if $\reqtc$ is a set of instances
 and if \fgparalleldiag in $\catc$, then say that path $f$ is equivalent to path $g$ with respect to the requirement $R_C$ 
 (and write $f \pequiv g$) iff
in all instances $D \in \reqtc$, $D(f)=D(g)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a  category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances,
 and if \fgparalleldiag in $\catc$ such that $f \pequiv g$
 then say that the path equivalence $f \pequiv g$ is represented in \catcw iff
 $f=g$.
\end{definition}

\begin{oldtt}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a  category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances,
 then say that  $\catc$ is \term{logically complete} with respect 
to the requirement $\reqtc$ iff all path equivalences with respect to $R_C$ are represented in \catcw 
i.e. iff for all diagrams \fgparalleldiag in $\catc$,  
if in all instances $D \in \reqtc$, $D(f)=D(g)$,  then $f=g$ in $\catc$.
\end{definition}
\end{oldtt}

\textbf{Goodness Principle 2A:} If \catcw is a catgeory and $R_C$ is a requirement then \catc should be complete
with respect to $R_C$ that is all path equivalences with respect to $R_C$ as a requirment for \catcw should be represented in \catc.

\subsubsection{The Principle of the Representation of Functional Dependencys}

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances and if \fgsourcediag
in $\catc$ then there is a  \term{functional dependency} of $g$ on $f$ with respect to $\reqtc$ iff
there is a family of functions $H_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$ such that 
in each instance $D$, $H_D$ is a unique function $H_D: D(b) \morph D(c)$, such that $D(f) \circ H_D = D(g)$. 
If there is such a functional dependency then we say that $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ in $\catc$ with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{definition}

Our use of the $\morph$ notation for functional dependencies here is coming from relational database theory where it is usual to represent such a functional dependency as we have here by asserting that 
$$
f \morph g
$$
Note that this use of an $\morph$ notation is independent of our use of $\morph$ as a morphism of a category 
or, for that matter, as an edge in a presentation. Neither are we alluding to a bicategory structure. We have two distinct uses for $\morph$ (three if you distinguish arrows in presentations from arrows in categories). Any particular use will be unambiguous in context.

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, if
\fgsourcediag
in $\catc$ 
and if there is a functional dependency $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ then say that 
the functional dependency $H$ is \term{represented} in $\catc$ 
iff there exists a morphism $h:b \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that for each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(h)=H_D$.
\end{definition}

\textbf {Goodness Principle 2B:} If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, then all functional dependencies
should be represented.


\subsubsection{The Principle of the Representation of Referential Inclusion Dependencies}

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances 
and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$, then a \term{referential inclusion dependency} $I$, written $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$, is a family of functions $I_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$
such that each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $I_D$ is a unique function $I_D : D(a) \morph D(c)$ such that
for each $i$, $1 \leq i \le n$, $I_D \circ D(q_i) = D(f_i)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$ and if $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$ is a referential inclusion dependency
with respect  to $\reqtc$ then say that the inclusion dependency $I$ is \term{represented} in $\catc$
iff there exists a morphism $i:a \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that in each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(i) = I_D$. 
\end{definition}

\textbf {Goodness Principle 2C:} If \catcw is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, then all referential inclusion dependencies present in $R_C$
should be represented in \catc.
