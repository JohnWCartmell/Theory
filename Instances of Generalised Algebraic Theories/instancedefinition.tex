In this section, we will define an instance of a generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual category \catcw to be a consistent mapping 
of derived T-rules and $\in$-rules of  $U$ to objects, respectively sections of \catc. 
We will show that such instances are totally defined by their mapping of the introductory rules of the theory and we will define how to extend 
consistent and valid interpretations $\iI$ of the introductory rules   to instances $\Ibar$ that consistently map all the derived  T-rules and $\in$-rules.
To make this work, we need define $\Ibar$ as a partial mapping which, when $\iI$ is consistent and valid, we subsequently show to be total. For this reason we need definitions that apply to partial mappings of rules.

If $I$ is a  possibly partial mapping of derived T-rules and $\in$-rules of a theory $U$ to objects, respectively sections of a contextual category \catcw then
\begin{itemize}
\item
For any non-empty context $\xDelta{n}$ of $U$, by the mapping under $I$ of this context we shall mean the mapping under $I$ of the derived rule
\IDelta{n}.  
\item
By the mapping under $I$ of the empty context we shall mean the terminal object $1$ of \catc.
\item
For $m \geq 0$, if  $Q$ and $\yOmega{m}$ are contexts and if $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation of $\yOmega{m}$ wrt $Q$ in $U$
then we will define the mapping of  $\tuple{\sm}$ under $I$ to be the tuple of sections
$\tuple{I(r_{s_1}),...I(r_{s_m})}$, 
where \foreachj, $r_{s_j}$ is the derived rule \IsOmega{j}.
We will say that the realisation $\tuple{\sm}$ is mapped to a cascade iff
 $I(r_{s_j})$ is defined, \foreachj, and 
 $\tuple{I(r_{s_1}),...I(r_{s_m})}$ is a cascade of sections i.e. \foreachj, 
 $I(r_{s_j}) \in Sect(I(r_{s_{j-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1}))$,
where $r_{\Omega_j}$ is the derived rule \IOmega{j}. Note that according to this description the empty realisation, which is a realisation of the empty context with respect to any other context, is deemed to map to a cascade under $I$.  \commentary{Do we need modify defn. of cascade in line with this?}

\highlight{END of DEFINITION OF consistently interpreted}


Since the above definition of a rule being consistently interpreted relies on whether other rules are consistently interpreted we need to check that there are no circularities:
\begin{lemma}
The above property of a rule being consistently interpreted by a mapping of rules is well-defined. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The definition in the case of T-rules relies on the definition of other T-rules being consistently interpreted but these other rules are of lower rank and therefore there is no circularity 
(the definition terminates).
Neither are there circularities in the other cases because either they make no recursive references to consistent interpretation (the $\in$-rules case)
\commentary{watch out for $\in$-rule case
 changing}
or they make recursive references to T-rules (the T=-rule case) or to $\in$-rules (the $\in$=-rules case).
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
An \term{instance} of a generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual category \catcw is  any mapping 
of derived T-rules and $\in$-rules of the theory $U$ to objects, respectively sections of the contextual category \catcw that
consistently interprets every derived rule of $U$ and such that
if both \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} and \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}} are derived rules of $U$ then 
$\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}}=\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}}$
\end{definition}

We will show that an instance $I$ of a generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual category \catcw is
completely determined by its mapping of the introductory rules of sort symbols and operator symbols to
objects, respectively, sections of \catc. To state this precisely  we require a number of defintions.

\begin{definition}
If $U$ is a generalised algebraic theory  and if \catcw is a contextual category then
a \term{interpretation} $\iI$ of  $U$ in \catcw consists of a pair :
\begin{itemize}
\item a mapping $\Isort$ that maps each sort symbol of $U$ to  an object of \catc,
\item a mapping $\Iop$ that maps each operator symbol of $U$ to a section of \catcw (i.e. to a morphism $f: A \morph B$ for some 
$A \base B$ in \catcw such that $f \circ p_B=id_A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We will say that  an interpretation $\iI$ of $U$ in \catcw \term{determines} an  instance $I$ of $U$ in \catcw to mean that for each sort symbol $A$ of $U$,
$I(r_A) = \iI_{sort}(A)$, where $r_A$ is the introductory rule for $A$ and that for each operator symbol
$f$ of $U$,   $I(r_f) = \iI_{op}(f)$, where $r_f$ is the introductory rule for $f$.

We will show (lemma \lref{uniquenessofinstancedeterminedbyaninterpretation}) that 
if $\iI$ is an interpretation of a generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual catgeory \catcw then
there is at most one  instance determined by $\iI$.
\begin{oldtt}
To prove this we show that if $\iI$ determines an instance $I$ then
the partial mapping which we define below as $\Ibar$  is total and is an instance and that
the instance $I$ determined by $\iI$ is  $\Ibar$.
\end{oldtt}

\begin{definition} [\highlight{Definition of  $\Ibar$}]
If $\iI$ is an interpretation of generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual catgeory \catcw
then define a
partial mapping $\Ibar$  of T-rules and $\in$-rules to objects, respectively sections, of \catcw
as follows
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item \underline{\textbf{T-rules}} 
The derivation lemma (lemma \ref{derivationlemma}) tells us that if $r_\Delta$ is a derived T-rule of $U$  then it is of the form \gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{A(t_1,...t_n)}} for some premise $P$, for some $n \geq 0$ and for some sort symbol $A$ with introductory rule $r_A$ of the form \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{A(x_1,...x_n)}}, where \foreachi, the rule 
\ItDelta[P]{i}  is a derived rule of $U$. 
We define $\Ibar(r_\Delta)$ to be undefined unless the following preconditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
the context  $P$ is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(P)$ of \catcw and 
\item
\foreachi, the rule $\IDelta{i}$, which we denote $r_{\Delta_i}$, is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})$ of \catcw
and $1 \base \Ibar(r_{\Delta_1}),...\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n}) \base \iI_{sort}(A)$ in \catcw 
\item
$\tuple{\tn}$ is mapped to a cascade by $\Ibar$
\end{enumerate}
in which case we define $\Ibar(r_\Delta)$ to be $\Ibar(r_{t_n})^*...\Ibar(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{\Ibar(P)}{\Ibar(A)}{1})$,
where $r_{t_i}$ is the rule \ItDelta[P][.]{i}
\item \underline{\textbf{$\boldsymbol {\in}$-rules}} 
The derivation lemma also tells us that if $r_t$ is an $\in$-rule then it is  
either \highlight{(1)} of the form \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Omega}} for some $n \ge 1$, for some $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, 
and for some $\Omega$ such that \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\Delta_i=\Omega} is a derived rule of $U$
or \highlight{(2)} it is of the form \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{f(t_1,...t_n)}{\Omega}} for some premise $P$, for some $n \geq 0$ and for some operator symbol $f$ with introductory rule $r_f$ of the form \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{f(x_1,...x_n)}{\Delta}} where \foreachi, the rule 
\ItDelta[P]{i}, which we will call $r_{t_i}$, is a derived rule of $U$. 

In  case (1) we define $\Ibar(r_t)$ to be undefined unless  the following preconditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\foreachi, the rule $\IDelta{i}$, which we denote $r_{\Delta_i}$, is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})$ of \catcw
and $1 \base \Ibar(r_{\Delta_1}),...\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n})$ in \catcw 
\item the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega}}, which we call $r_\Omega$, 
is mapped by $\Ibar$ to the object $\crossx{\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n})}{\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})}{\kern-4pt\Ibar(r_{\Delta_{i-1}})\kern-12pt}$
\end{enumerate}
in which case we define $\Ibar(r_t)$ to be $s(p_{\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n}),\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})})$ . 

In  case (2) 
we define $\Ibar(r_t)$ to be undefined unless  unless the following preconditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the context  $P$ is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(P)$ of \catcw and 
\item
\foreachi, the rule $\IDelta{i}$, which we denote $r_{\Delta_i}$, is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})$ of \catcw
and  
%\foreachi, the context $\xDelta{i}$ is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $b_i$ of \catcw
and 
\item the rule \ZDelta, which we shall call $r_\Delta$, is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $\Ibar(r_\Delta)$ of \catcw and
$1 \base \Ibar(r_{\Delta_1}),...\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n}) \base \Ibar(r_\Delta)$ in \catcw 
and 
\item
%\foreachi, $\Ibar(r_{t_i}) \in Sect(r_{t_{i-1}}^*...r_1^* (\crossx{a}{b}{1}))$
$\tuple{\tn}$ is mapped to a cascade by $\Ibar$,
\end{enumerate}
in which case we
define $\Ibar(r_t)=\Ibar(r_{t_n})^*...\Ibar(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{\Ibar(P)}{\iI_{op}(f)}{1})$.
This completes the definition of $\Ibar$.
\end{enumerate}

 Suppose that $\iI$ is an interpretation of $U$  
define interpretation $\iI$ to be \term{valid}  iff 

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
for all sort symbols $A$ of $U$ if $A$ has introductory rule $r_A$ then $\Ibar(r_A)$ is defined,
\item  
for all operator symbols $f$ of $U$ if $f$ has introductory rule $r_f$ then $\Ibar(r_f)$ is defined,

\item \underline{\textbf{T=-axioms}}

\ZtDelta and  
and $r'_t$ is the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{t'}{\Delta'}}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Now we can state precisely how an interpretation $\iI$ determines an instance: 
Suppose that $\iI$ is an interpretation of $U$  then $\iI$ is valid  iff $\iI$ determines an instance. 
If $\iI$ does determine an instance then that instance is $\Ibar$.
The remainder of this section leads to a proof of this statement in
lemma  \lref{avalidinterpretationisaninstance} at the end of this section.

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{towerlemma}
\IfIpartialmappingUtoC, if $r$ is a derived rule \ZDelta of $U$ and if
$r$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
then \foreachi, $r_{\Delta_i}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ and

where, for each $i$, $r_{\Delta_i}$ is the rule \IDelta{i}.

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{substitutionsublemma}
\IfIpartialmappingUtoC,
then if $r_s$ is the $\in$-rule \ZsOmega and 
$r_s$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ then
for all contexts $Q$ and for all realisations $\tuple{\sm}$ of $\yOmega{m}$ wrt $Q$  
which are mapped to a cascade by $I$,
$$ \Imappedrule{Q}{\ofT{s[\SUBsFORy{m}]}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}

where \foreachj, $r_{s_j}$ is the rule \IsOmega{j} and where
$r_\Omega$ is the rule \ZOmega.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The definition of consistent interpretation directly requires this for non-variables. 
It remains to show  this in the case when $s$ is a variable. Suppose $s$ is the variable
$y_j$. Since in this case $s[\SUBsFORy{m}]$ is $s_j$ what we have to show is that
$I(s_j) = I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{s(p_{I(r_{\Omega_m}),I(r_{\Omega_j})}}{1}))$,
where \foreachj, $r_{\Omega_j}$ is the rule \IOmega{j}. This is given by lemma \lref{cascadeprojectionlemma}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{typeweakeninglemma}
\IfIpartialmappingUtoC,
if \ZOmega is a derived rule of $U$  which  is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
and if $Q$ is a context and $I(Q)$ is defined 
then $\Imappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_1}}=\crossx{I(Q)}{\Imappedrule{}{\isT{\Omega_1}}}{1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since \ZOmega is consistently interpreted by $I$ then it follows by lemma \lref{towerlemma} that the rule 
\gatdisplayrule{}{\isT{\Omega_1}} (the rule with empty context and asserting $\Omega_1$ to be a type) is interpreted consistently
by $I$. Since $Q$ is a context and since the empty tuple $\tuple{}$ is a realisation of the empty context with respect to $Q$ that, by definition, maps to a cascade then it follows from the definition of what it means for  \gatdisplayrule{}{\isT{\Omega}} to be consistently interpreted by $I$ that
$\Imappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_1}}=\crossx{I(Q)}{\Imappedrule{}{\isT{\Omega_1}}}{1}$, as required.
\end{proof}
The following lemma establishes that if all the elements of a realisation are consistently interpreted by a mapping then the elements are 
mapped to a cascade. 
\begin{lemma}
\llabel{realisationmapstocascade}
\commentary{use to be labelled substitutionpropertyvariant}
\newcommand {\forceSOURCEwidth}{\rule{5cm}{0pt}}  % so as to line up three different arrays
\newcommand {\forceTARGETwidth}{\rule{2.2cm}{0pt}}
If $I$ is a partial mapping of T-rules and $\in$-rules of a theory $U$ to objects, respectively sections of a contextual category \catc,
 if $Q$  and $\encyOmega{m}$ are contexts, for some $m \geq 1$,  and if $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation of $\tuple{\yOmega{m}}$ with respect to $Q$,
 if \foreachj, the rule \IsOmega{j} is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
 and if the rule \IOmega{m} is consistently interpreted by $I$
then the realisation $\tuple{s_1,...s_m}$ is mapped by $I$ to a cascade.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It follows from the definition of cascade that we need to establish, \foreachj, that
 $$I(r_{s_j}) \in Sect(I(r_{s_{j-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1})) ,$$
  where $r_{s_j}$ is the rule \IsOmega{j} and $r_{\Omega_j}$ is the rule \IOmega{j}.
To prove this in the case of $m=1$ we need simply show that 
 $$I(r_{s_1}) \in Sect(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_1})}{1})).$$
 This follows because from the initial assumption that $r_{s_1}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ and so by definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}, clause (ii),
 I(Q) is defined and  $I(r_{s_1}) \in Sect(I\big(\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_1}}\big))$ 
 and because \IOmega{m} is consistently interpreted by $I$ we can use lemma \lref{typeweakeninglemma} to establish $I(\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_1}}) = \crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_1})}{1})$.

Next we complete the proof by showing that the proposition that the lemma holds at a given $m$ follows from
the assumption that it holds at $m-1$. So assume that $Q$  and $\encyOmega{m}$ are contexts, 
that $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation of $\tuple{\yOmega{m}}$ with respect to $Q$,
assume that \foreachj, the rule \IsOmega{j} is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
and that the rule $r_{\Omega_m}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$. 
From these assumptions it follows
that  $\tuple{\sm[-1]}$ is a realisation of $\tuple{\yOmega{m-1}}$ with respect to $Q$.
Now since $r_{\Omega_m}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ it follows, by definition,  that $r_{\Omega_{m-1}}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$. This means that we can use the inductive hypothesis to establish that $\tuple{\sm[-1]}$ maps to a cascade which is to say that \foreachj[m-1],  
$$I(r_{s_j}) \in Sect(I(r_{s_{j-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1})).$$

It only remains to show that
$$I(r_{s_m}) \in Sect(I(r_{s_{m-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_m})}{1})).$$ \

This we can do because first of all, since we are given that $r_{s_m}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ and using definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}, clause (ii), we establish that
$$I(r_{s_m}) \in Sect(\Imappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_m[\SUBsFORy{m-1}]}}.$$ 
Next, because $r_{\Omega_m}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ then using definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}, clause (i)(c), 
and since we have from the inductive hypothesis that $\tuple{\sm[-1]}$ is a realisation of $\tuple{\yOmega{m-1}}$ with respect to $Q$ that maps to a cascade,
we establish that
 $$\Imappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega_m[\SUBsFORy{m-1}]}}= I(r_{s_{m-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_m})}{1}).$$
 \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{substitutioninterpretationlemma}
\IfIpartialmappingUtoC,
if we suppose that $Q$ and $\encyOmega{m}$ are contexts, for some $m \geq 1$, 
and that $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation of $\encyOmega{m}$ wrt $Q$ and
if we suppose that \foreachj, the rule \IsOmega{j} is consistently interpreted by $I$ then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if \ZOmega is a derived rule which is consistently interpreted by $I$
then the derived rule \ZOmegaSUBsmFORym is consistently interpreted by $I$,
\item if \ZsOmega is a derived rule which is consistently interpreted by $I$
then the derived rule \ZsOmegaSUBsmFORym is consistently interpreted by $I$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose  $Q$ to be the context $\xDelta{n}$, for some $n \geq 0$. Let $r_{\Delta_i}$, \foreachi, be the rule \IDelta{i}.

The rule \IDelta{n} is a derived rule of $U$ because we have assumed that $Q$ is a context. 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
\newcommand{\targetruleone}{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}
Let $r_\Omega$ be the rule \ZOmega and assume it to be consistently interpreted by $I$.
To show that the rule \ZOmegaSUBsmFORym is consistently interpreted by $I$ we need show that conditions (a), (b) and (c)
of clause (i) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} hold for this rule.
To  show  that condition (a) holds we have to show that $I(r_{\Delta_n})$ is defined 
and $\Imap{\targetruleone}$ is defined and that  $I(r_{\Delta_n}) \base \Imap{\targetruleone}$ in \catc. 
That $I(r_{\Delta_n})$ is defined follows from the initial assumption
that the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s_1}{\Omega_1}} is consistently interpreted by $I$
and from condition (ii)(b) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}. 
By  lemma \lref{towerlemma} it then follows that 
$1 \base I(r_{\Delta_1}) \base ... I(r_{\Delta_{n-1}}) \base I(r_{\Delta_n})$ in \catc.
Also because \foreachj,  we assume that the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s_j}{\Omega_j[\SUBsFORy{j-1}]}} is consistently interpreted by $I$, 
we deduce that $\tuple{\sm}$ is mapped to a cascade by $I$, by lemma \lref{realisationmapstocascade}. Hence 
from condition (i)(a) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} and the assumption that $r_\Omega$ is consistently interpreted it follows that $\Imap{\targetruleone}$ is defined and 
\begin{equation}
\label{omegaSubsmapping}
\Imap{\targetruleone} = I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_\Omega)}{1})
\end{equation}
and thus that $I(r_{\Delta_n}) \base \Imap{\targetruleone}$ in \catcw as required by clause (a).

In fact by the same argument and from the fact that \foreachj,  
the realisation $\tuple{s_1,...s_{j-1}}$ is mapped to a cascade by $I$ and from lemma \lref{towerlemma} that tells us that 
$r_{\Omega_j}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ we have that
$\displaystyle\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega_j[\SUBsFORy{j-1}]}}$ is defined and 
\begin{equation}
\label{omegajSubsmapping}
\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega_j[\SUBsFORy{j-1}]}} 
= I(r_{s_{j-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_j})}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1})
\end{equation}

Next, for clause (b), we are required to show that $r_{\Delta_n}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$. 
This follows from the fact that 
the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s_1}{\Omega_1}}  is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
and from condition (ii)(b) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}.

Finally, for clause (c), assume that $P$ is a context,
assume $\tuple{\tn}$ is a realisation of $\xDelta{n}$ with respect to $P$ that is mapped to a cascade by $I$, 
we must show that
$$\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}][\SUBtFORx{n}]}}
                =I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}{1}\big),$$
where each $r_{t_i}$ is the rule $\ItDelta{i}$.
By rearrangement of the lhs and by use of (\ref{omegaSubsmapping}) this means that we need to show 
\begin{multline}
\label{ctarget}
\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega[s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_1,... s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_m]}} \\
                =I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_\Omega)}{1})}{1}\big)
\end{multline}

\newcommand{\IOmegaDoublySubstituted}[1]{\Omega_#1[\SUBsFORy{#1-1}][\SUBtFORx{n}]}
Now, each $r_{s_j}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ and $\tuple{\tn}$ is a realisation
of the context $\xDelta{n}$ with respect to $P$ that is mapped to a cascade by $I$ and therefore using 
by condition (c) of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} we have 
\begin{multline*}
\Imappedrule{P}{\ofT{s_j[\SUBtFORx{n}]}{\IOmegaDoublySubstituted{j}}}
           = I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{s_j})} {1}\big) \\
           \in Sect\Big(I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega_j[\SUBsFORy{j-1}]}}} {1}\Big)\Big)
\end{multline*}

and since
\begin{align*}
I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega_j[\SUBsFORy{j-1}]}}} {1}\Big)\kern-8.5cm\\
        & = I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{ I(r_{s_{j-1}})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(Q)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1}\big)} {1}\Big) 
                                                               &&      \mbox{by  (\lref{omegajSubsmapping})}\\
        & =  \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_{j-1}})}{1})\Big)
               ^* ... 
             \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_1})}{1})\Big)
               ^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1}\Big)
                                                            &&  \mbox{by lemma \lref{cascadedpullbackscohere}}
\end{align*}
then we have
\begin{multline*}
\Imappedrule{P}{\ofT{s_j[\SUBtFORx{n}]}{\IOmegaDoublySubstituted{j}}}
           = I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{s_j})} {1}\big) \\
\in Sect\bigg( \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_{j-1}})}{1})\Big)
               ^* ... 
             \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_1})}{1})\Big)
               ^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{\Omega_j})}{1}\Big) 
        \bigg)
\end{multline*}

and so 
$\tuple{s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}],...s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]}$ is a realisation of $\yOmega{m}$ with repect to $P$
that is mapped to a cascade by $I$
and we can use the initial assumption that $r_\Omega$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
to establish that
\begin{multline}
     \Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Omega\big[s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_1,... s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_m\big]}} \\
           =  \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_m})}{1}\big)\Big)
               ^* ... 
              \Big(I(r_{t_n})^*...I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_{s_1})}{1}\big)\Big)
               ^*\Big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_\Omega)}{1}\Big)
\end{multline}
the rhs of which can be rearranged using equation (\lref{cascadedpullbackscohereonobjects}) of lemma \ref{cascadedpullbackscohere}   so as to establish
equation (\ref{ctarget}) as required to show that condition (c) holds.

\item 
\newcommand{\targetruletwo}{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s[\SUBsFORy{m}]}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}
Now let $r_s$ be the rule \ZsOmega and assume this rule to be consistently interpreted by $I$ as defined
in clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}. Condition (b) of the definition tells us that
\targetruleone must be consistently interpreted by $I$ and therefore in this part (ii) of the proof we can use
anything or everything established in part (i) of this proof.

We need to show that the rule \ZsOmegaSUBsmFORym is consistently interpreted by $I$ and for this we need show that conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d)
of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} hold for this rule.

To show that condition (a) holds we need show that $I(r_{\Delta_n})$ and $\Imap{\targetruleone}$ are defined, which we have established already in part (i),
and that $$\Imap{\targetruletwo} \in Sect\big(\Imap{\targetruleone}\big).$$
This follows from the initial assumption that \ZsOmega is consistently interpreted by $I$ 
and because we have already established that $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation which is mapped to a cascade by $I$
and from which we can use condition (c) of clause (ii) of lemma \ref{consistentinterpretation} to deduce that
\begin{multline}
\label{targetrule2mapping}
\Imap{\targetruletwo} = I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_s)}{1})\\
                      \in Sect\big(\Imap{\targetruleone}\big)
\end{multline}
To show that condition (b) holds we have to show that the rule \targetruleone is consistently interpreted by $I$. 
This is established in part (i) of this proof.

To show that condition (c) holds assume that $P$ is a context and $\tuple{\tn}$ is a realisation as described in part (i) of this proof.
We need to show that 
\begin{multline}
\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s[\SUBsFORy{m}][\SUBtFORx{n}]}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}][\SUBtFORx{n}]}} \\
                =I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s[\SUBsFORy{m}]}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}{1}\big),
\end{multline}

which after rearangement of the lhs and use of (\ref{targetrule2mapping}) means that we need to show that

\begin{multline}
\label{ctargettwo}
\Imappedrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{s[s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_1,... s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_m]}{\Omega[s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_1,... s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_m]}}\\
                =I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{I(r_s)}{1})}{1}\big)
\end{multline}
Similarly to part (i) of this proof, 
this follows because $\tuple{s[s_1[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_1,... s_m[\SUBtFORx{n}]|y_m]}$
is a realisation which is mapped by $I$ to a cascade,
from the initial assumption that 
\ZsOmega is a derived rule which is consistently interpreted by $I$
and by use of equation (\lref{cascadedpullbackscohereonsections}) of lemma \ref{cascadedpullbackscohere}.

Finally, we need show that condition (d) holds in the case that the expression $s[\SUBsFORy{m}]$ is simply a variable. For this to be the case the
expression $s$ must be a variable, $y_j$, say, and the expression $s_j$ must be a variable $x_i$, say,  
so that the expression $s[\SUBsFORy{m}]$ is simply the variable $x_i$. To show that condition (d) holds we need to show that
$$\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}=s(p_{r_{\Delta_n},r_{\Delta_i}}).$$
This is established as follows:
\begin{align*}
\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}}}\kern-3cm\\
&=I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*\Big(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})}{\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{y_j}{\Omega}}}} {1}  \Big) 
                                                                               && \mbox{by condition (c) of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}, }\\
&=I(r_{s_m})^*...I(r_{s_1})^*\Big(\crossx{I(r_{\Delta_n})} {s(p_{r_{\Omega_m},r_{\Omega_j}})} {1}  \Big) 
                                                                               && \mbox{because $r_s$ is consistently interpreted by $I$, } \\
&=I(r_{s_j})                                                                   && \mbox{by lemma \lref{cascadeprojectionlemma}}, \\

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{Ibartowerlemma}
If $\iI$ is an interpretation of generalised algebraic theory $U$ in contextual category \catc,
Suppose that  $r_\Omega$ is a derived T-rule \ZOmega of a generalised algebraic theory $U$
and suppose that \foreachj, $r_{\Omega_j}$ is the derived rule
\IOmega{j},
if $\iI$ is an interpretation of $U$ in a contextual category \catcw
such that $\Ibar(r_\Omega)$ is defined then
$\Ibar(r_j)$ is defined \foreachj, and 
$1 \base Ibar(r_1) \base  ... \base \Ibar(r_m) \base \Ibar(r)$ in \catc.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It follows from the definition of $\Ibar$ that since $\Ibar(r)$ is defined that $\Ibar(r_m)$ is defined and that
$\Ibar(r_m) \base \Ibar(r)$ in \catc. Now we can repeat and argue that $\Ibar(r_{m-1})$ is defined and that $\Ibar(r_{m-1}) \base \Ibar(r_m)$
in \catc. By induction $1 \base \Ibar(r_1) \base  ... \base \Ibar(r_m) \base \Ibar(r)$ in \catc, as required.

\begin{lemma}
\llabel{uniquenesssublemma}
If $I$ and $I'$ are instances of a generalised algebraic theory $U$ in a contextual category \catcw and if \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}
is a derived rule of $U$ such that $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}}=\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}}$
then
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
$\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}=\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}$
\item
$I(P)=I'(P)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
The rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} is a derived rule of $U$ and so 
it is consistently interpreted by $I$ since $I$ is an instance and therefore 
$\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} \in Sect \big(\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}})$ by condition (a) of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}.
Likewise it follows that $\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} \in Sect \big(\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}})$.
But $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} = \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}}$ and therefore
$Sect \big(\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}})=Sect \big(\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}})$
and therefore $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}=\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}$.
\item
The rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}} is a derived rule of $U$ and so 
it is consistently interpreted by $I$ since $I$ is an instance and therefore 
$I(P) \base \Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}$ in \catcw by condition (a) of clause (i) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} . 
Likewise it follows that  $I'(P) \base \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}$ in \catc. 
But $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}} = \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{\Delta}}}$ and therefore $I(P)=I'(P)$.

\begin{lemma} 
\llabel{uniquenessofinstancedeterminedbyaninterpretation}
If $\iI$ is an interpretation of generalised algebraic theory $U$ in contextual catgeory \catcw that determines instances $I$ and $I'$ of $U$ then
$I=I'$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We show that for all derived  T- and $\in$-rules of $U$, $I(r)=I'(r)$.  
The proof proceeds by induction on the derivation of $r$. 
We need only consider principles T1, CF1, CF2(a) and CF2(b), for these are the only principles by which  T-rules and $\in$-rules may be derived.\\
\underline{T1}
By this principle from \gatdisplayrule{P}{\Delta=\Delta'} and \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} we can derive \gatdisplayrule[.]{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}
Assume the inductive hypothesis that $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} = \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}}$.
We need show that $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}} = \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}}$.
This follows because from the definition of instance we have that $\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} = \Imap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}}$
and $\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}} = \Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}}$.
\\

\underline{CF1} According to this principle, 
whenever a rule of the form \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta_{n+1}}} is a derived rule of $U$ for some $n \geq 0$
then so to is the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}}, \foreachi[n+1], where $x_{n+1}$ is any variable distinct from each of the variables $\xn$. For each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n+1$, let $r_{\Delta_i}$ be the rule \IDelta{i}. Assume the inductive hypothesis that
$I(r_{\Delta_{n+1}})=I'(r_{\Delta_{n+1}})$. Because $I$ and $I'$ are instances they both consistently interpret the rule $r_{\Delta_{n+1}}$
and so it follows by lemma \lref{towerlemma} that
$I(r_{\Delta_i})=I'(r_{\Delta_i})$, \foreachi. Now, since \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}} is a derived rule
of $U$ and is therefore consistently interpreted by both $I$ and $I'$
it follows by condition (d) of clause (ii) of defintion \lref{consistentinterpretation} that
$
\Imap{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}}}
=s(p_{I(r_{\Delta_{n+1}}),I(r_{\Delta_{i}})})
=s(p_{I'(r_{\Delta_{n+1}}),I'(r_{\Delta_{i}})})
=\Ipmap{\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}}}
$, as required.

\underline{CF2(a)} 
By this principle, from a sort symbol $A$ with introductory rule $r_A$ of the form \gatdisplayrule[,]{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{A(\xn)}} for  $n \geq 0$, if
$P$ is a context and if in particular the rule $r_P$ asserting that $P$ is a context is a derived rule of $U$
and from derived rules $r_{t_i}$ of the form \ItDelta[P]{i}, \foreachi, we may deduce
the rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{A(t_1,...t_n)}}, which we shall denote by $r$, is a derived rule of $U$. 
Because the introductory rule for $A$ is a derived rule of $U$ \footnote{Should really have a lemma for this} and is therefore consistently interpreted by $I$
since $I$ is an instance, and since  each rule $r_{t_i}$ is consistently interpreted by $I$ we have by lemma \lref{realisationmapstocascade}
that $\tuple{\tn}$ is mapped to a cascade by $I$ and hence by condition (c) of clause (i) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation}
the rule $r$ is mapped  by $I$ to
$I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_A)}{1}\big)$, where $r_A$ is the introductory rule for $A$.
Similarly $r$ is mapped by $I'$ to
$I'(t_n)^* ... I'(t_1)^*\big(\crossx{I'(P)}{I'(r_A)}{1}\big)$.
By the inductive hypothesis we have both that $I(r_{t_i})=I'(r_{t_i})$, for each $i$, and that $I(P)=I'(P)$,  and 
because both $I$ and $I'$ are instances which extend interpretation $\iI$
we have that $I(r_A)=\iI(f)=I'(r_A)$. Therefore $I(r)=I'(r)$.
\\

\underline{CF2(b)} By this principle, from a operator symbol $f$ with introductory rule $r_f$ of the form \gatdisplayrule[,]{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{f(\xn)}{\Delta}} for some $n \geq 0$, if
$P$ is a context and if in particular the rule $r_P$ asserting that $P$ is a context is a derived rule of $U$
and from derived rules $r_{t_i}$ of the form \ItDelta[P]{i}, \foreachi, we may deduce
the rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{f(t_1,...t_n)}{\Delta[\SUBtFORx{n}]}}, which we shall denote by $r_t$, is a derived rule of $U$. 
Because the introductory rule for $f$ is a derived rule of $U$ \footnote{Should really have a lemma for this} and therefore consistently interpreted by $I$
since $I$ is an instance, and because, as above,  $\tuple{\tn}$ is mapped to a cascade by $I$,
by condition (c) of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} the rule $r_t$ is mapped  by $I$ to
$I(r_{t_n})^* ... I(r_{t_1})^*\big(\crossx{I(P)}{I(r_f)}{1}\big)$, where $r_f$ is the introductory rule for $f$.
Similarly $r_t$ is mapped by $I'$ to
$I'(t_n)^* ... I'(t_1)^*\big(\crossx{I'(P)}{I'(r_f)}{1}\big)$.
By the inductive hypothesis we have both that $I(r_{t_i})=I'(r_{t_i})$, for each $i$, and that $I(P)=I'(P)$,  and 
because both $I$ and $I'$ are instances which extend interpretation $\iI$
we have that $I(r_f)=\iI(f)=I'(r_f)$. Therefore $I(r_t)=I'(r_t)$.
\end{proof}

Now for the main lemma:
\begin{lemma}
\llabel{avalidinterpretationisaninstance}
Suppose that $\iI$ is an interpretation of $U$  then if $\iI$ is valid  then $\Ibar$ is an instance.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
\newcommand {\forceSOURCEwidth}{\rule{5cm}{0pt}}  % so as to line up three different arrays
\newcommand {\forceTARGETwidth}{\rule{2.2cm}{0pt}}
We need to show that for every derived rule $r$ of $U$, $\Ibar(r)$ is defined and $r$ is consistently interpreted\footnote{To be formally correct we need a definition of \textit{consistently interpreted} for partial mappings of rules not just total mappings -- since here at the point we use the definition we have not yet proved $\Ibar$ to be total.} by $\Ibar$. 
We prove this by induction on the derivation of rules in $U$. We examine each of the principles of derivation in turn
and show that given the stated assumptions then from rules for which $\Ibar$ is defined and which are consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ 
it is only possible to derive rules for which $\Ibar$ is defined and which themselves are consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$.
The principles of derivation (see \cite{Cartmell86}) are LI1, ... LI7, T1, CF1, CF2(a) and CF2(b), SI1 and SI2. 
The proof of this  in each the cases  LI1,...LI6 is quite trivial. We consider each of the remaining principles in turn. 
 \\
\underline{LI7} \commentary{This is not quite trivial but related to principle T1.}  \\

\tbd
\underline{T1}
By this principle from \gatdisplayrule{P}{\Delta=\Delta'} and \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} we can derive \gatdisplayrule[.]{P}{\ofT{t}{\Delta'}}
By the inductive hypothesis we assume that rule  \gatdisplayrule{P}{\Delta=\Delta'} is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ i.e. that
$\Ibar$ is defined at both $r_\Delta$ and $r_{\Delta'}$  and that $\Ibar(r_\Delta) = \Ibar(r_{\Delta'})$
and we also assume that $\Ibar$ is defined at $r_{t\Delta}$ and that this rule
is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ i.e. that $\Ibar(r_{t\Delta}) \in Sect(I(r_{\Delta}))$.
We have to show that $\Ibar$ is defined at the rule $r_{t\Delta'}$ and that this rule, $r_{t\Delta'}$, is consistently interpreted 
by $\Ibar$ i.e. that $\Ibar(r_{t\Delta'}) \in Sect(I(r_{t\Delta'}))$. 
In addition, in the case that  $t$ is simply a variable we are required to show  that $\Ibar(r_{t\Delta'})$ has an appropriate value.

Now from the definition of $\Ibar$ it can be seen that providing that the preconditions are met then  the value of $\Ibar$ at $r_{t\Delta'}$  is the same
as the value at $r_{t\Delta}$ (since the definition of the value is independent of the type -- $\Delta$ or $\Delta'$) and therefore that the condition(s) for the consistent interpretation of $r_{t\Delta'}$ are met 
since we have that $Sect(I(r_{t\Delta'}))=Sect(I(r_{t\Delta}))$ as we have assumed that $I(r_{t\Delta'})=I(r_{t\Delta})$. 
Therefore we simply need to show that the preconditions
for $\Ibar$ being defined at $r_{t\Delta'}$ hold.
From examination of the preconditions for $\Ibar$ to be defined at $r_{t\Delta'}$ we see that, whether or not $t$ is simply a variable, 
each precondition is either independent of the type (i.e. $\Delta'$) in which case must hold,  as we have assumed that 
$\Ibar(r_{t\Delta})$ be defined,
 or  else  follows directly from our assumption that 
$\Ibar$ is defined both at $r_\Delta$  and $r_{\Delta'}$ and that $\Ibar(r_\Delta) = \Ibar(r_{\Delta'})$.\\


\underline{CF1} According to the principle, whenever a rule of the form \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta_{n+1}}} is a derived rule of $U$ 
then so to is the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}}, \foreachi[n+1], where $x_{n+1}$ is any variable distinct from each of the variables $\xn$.
We have to show that if $\Ibar$ is defined for and consistently interprets any such T-rule, which we will denote, $r_{\Delta_{n+1}}$, 
then so to is $\Ibar$ defined for and consistently interprets each associated rule $r_{x_i}$. 
We show that  if it is the case for $r_{x_j}$ all $j <i$ 
then it follows that it is the case for each rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_{i}}}, which we shall denote  $r_{x_i}$. 
In so doing we establish that it holds for all $i \leq n +1 $, as required. \commentary{pull through new conditions for consistent interpretation}

So, suppose that for each $j$, $j < i$, that $\Ibar$ is defined for and consistently interprets the rule $r_{x_j}$ i.e. suppose that  $\Ibar(r_{x_j})$ is defined and that
$\Ibar(r_{x_j})=s(p_{a_{n_1},a_j})$. 
We shall now show that it follows that 
$\Ibar$ is defined at the rule $r_{x_i}$ and that this rule is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ by showing that
$\Ibar(r_{x_i})=s(p_{a_{n_1},a_i})$. 

%Denote the former rule $r_{\Delta_{n+1}}$ and the latter rule $r_{x_i}$. 
First we have to show that the preconditions for $\Ibar$ to be defined at the rule $r_{x_i}$ hold. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item That \foreachi, the context $\xDelta{i}$ is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $a_i$ of \catcw such
that $1 \base a_1,...\base a_i$. This follows from lemma \lref{Ibartowerlemma}. \commentary{\highlight{CHECK}}

\item That the rule \DDelta{n+1}{i} is mapped by $\Ibar$ to the object $\crossx{a_{n+1}}{a_i}{a_{i-1}}$.

This we can show as follows.
\newcommand{\deltaimapped}{\crossx{a_{n+1}}{a_i}{a_{i-1}}}
\newcommand{\deltaimappedlong}{s(p_{a_{n+1},a_{i-1}})^*...s(p_{a_{n+1},a_1})^*(\crossx{a_{n+1}}{a_i}{1})}
Let $r_{\Delta_i}$ be the rule \IDelta{i}.



Because $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i}) = a_i$,
because  we have that
$\tuple{x_1,...x_{i-1}}$ is a realisation of context $\xDelta{i-1}$ with respect to context $\Delta_{n+1}$ 
and since we have assumed for each $j<i$ that $r_{x_j}$ is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ and in particular
that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c }
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_j}{\Delta_j}}  & \Imapsto & s(p_{a_{n+1},a_j}) \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
and since we have assumed that $r_{\Delta_i}$ is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ and in particular that clause (ii)(b) of the definition of consistently interpreted holds
then we have that
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n+1}}{\isT{\Delta_i[x_1|x_1,...x_{i-1}|x_{i-1}]}}  & \Imapsto & \deltaimappedlong \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
i.e.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\DDelta{n+1}{i}  & \Imapsto & \deltaimappedlong.\\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
So we are done if we can prove that

\begin{equation*}
\deltaimappedlong = \deltaimapped
\end{equation*}  
This is given by lemma \lref{sofpsubstitutionlemma}
\end{enumerate}
Next we have to show that 
By showing that the relevant preconditions hold we have shown that $I(r_{x_i})$ is defined. 
To show that the rule $r_{x_i}$ is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ we just have to show that
 $\Ibar(r_{x_i})=s(p_{a_{n+1},a_i})$. But this is exactly the definition of $\Ibar$ at $r_{x_i}$. 
\begin{newtt}and that $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_i})=\crossx{a_n}{a_i}{1}$ which we have shown in 1. above.\end{newtt} \\
\underline{CF2(a)}
By this principle, from a sort symbol $A$ with introductory rule $r_A$ of the form \gatdisplayrule[,]{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{A(\xn)}} for some $n \geq 0$, if
$P$ is a context and if in particular the rule $r_P$ asserting that $P$ is a context is a derived rule of $U$
and from derived rules $r_{t_i}$ of the form \ItDelta[P]{i}, \foreachi, we may deduce
the rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\isT{A(t_1,...t_n)}}, which we shall denote by $r$, is a derived rule of $U$. \\

\noindent Assume as the inductive hypothesis that $\Ibar(r_{t_i})$ is defined \foreachi. We can show that $\Ibar(r)$ is defined providing we can show that conditions (a), (b) and (c) of part (i) of the definition of $\Ibar$ are met. \\
\noindent Precondition (a), that $P$ is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $b$ \highlight{$b_m$} of \catc, follows from the inductive hypothesis applied to  rule $r_P$ asserting that $P$ is a context.  \\
\noindent Precondition (b) follows from the assumption that $\Ibar$ is relatively well-typed because rule $r$ is well-typed relative to the theory
$U_p$ because $U$ is a generalised algebraic theory. 
\noindent Therefore $r_{\Delta_n}$ is a derived rule of $U_p$\\ and so $\predInstance(r_{\Delta_n})$ is defined  because $\predInstance$ is assumed to be total. 
Therefore $\Ibar(r_{\Delta_n})$ is defined since
$\Ibar$ extends $\predInstance$ since $\iI$ extends $I \restrict U_p$. 
\noindent  Precondition (c) follows firstly, because that \foreachi, $\Ibar(r_{t_i})$ is defined, is given by the inductive hypothesis and 
secondly, that $\Ibar(r_{t_i}) \in Sect(\Ibar(r_{t_{i-1}})^*...^*\Ibar(r_{t_{1}})^*(\crossx{b_m}{a_i}{1}))$ follows  from 
the inductive hypothesis {CHECK}.\\

\begin{newtt}
\highlight{Next show the substitution operates as it should.} 
                                                              \commentary{ Need unify the above and the below.} \\

\newcommand{\clausethreelhs}{(\gmvectorstar (\crossx{c}{f_n}{1}))^* ... (\gmvectorstar (\crossx{c}{f_1}{1})) ^* (\crossx{b_m}{I_A}{1})}
\newcommand{\clausethreerhs}{\gmvectorstar (  \crossx{c}{(\fnvectorstar(\crossx{b_m}{I_A}{1}))}{1} )}
\newcommand{\tirule}{\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{t_i}{\Delta_i[t_1 | x_1,...t_{i-1}|x_{i-1}]}}}
Now assume that $P$ is the context $\yOmega{m}$, for some $m \geq 0$, so that $r$ is the rule \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{A(\tn)}}
and suppose $r$  is mapped by $\Ibar$ to some object $b$ of \catcw such that $1 \base b_1 ... \base b_m \base b$. 

Now there are sections  $f_1,..f_n$  of \catcw such that, \foreachi, $\Ibar$ maps
\begin{equation}
\label{timapping}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\tirule    & \Imapsto & f_i \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation} 
Now from the definition of $\Ibar$, we have that $\Ibar$ maps
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{A(\tn)}}   & \Imapsto & \fnvectorstar(\crossx{b_m}{I_A}{1})\\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation*} 

Assume also  that $Q$ is a context and that $\tuple{\sm}$ is a realisation of $\tuple{\yOmega{m}}$ with respect to $Q$
and that there is the following mapping by $\Ibar$ into the objects and sections of \catc:
\begin{equation}
\label{sjmapping}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
Q          & \Imapsto & c   \\ [0.4cm]
\IsOmega{j}    & \Imapsto & g_j \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $g_j \in Sect(g_{j-1}^*...g_i^*(\crossx{c}{b_j}{1}))$ in \catc.

We have to establish that $\Ibar$ maps
\begin{equation}
\label{clauseiiirequiredmapping}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{A(t_1[\SUBsFORy{m}],...t_n[\SUBsFORy{m}])}}   & \Imapsto & \gmvectorstar (\crossx{c}{\fnvectorstar(\crossx{b_m}{I_A}{1})}{1}) \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Now, we deduce from \ the inductive hypothesis that $r_{t_i}$ is consistently interpreted and 
from condition (c) of clause (ii) of definition \lref{consistentinterpretation} from (\ref{timapping}) and from (\ref{sjmapping}) that \foreachi, $\Ibar$ maps
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\ofT{t_i[\SUBsFORy{m}]}{\Delta_i[t_1 | x_1,...t_{i-1}|x_{i-1}][\SUBsFORy{m}]}}  & \Imapsto & \gmvectorstar (\crossx{c}{f_i}{1}) \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and therefore from the definition of $\Ibar$ that it maps
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{c c c}
\forceSOURCEwidth & & \forceTARGETwidth \\ [-0.1cm]
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{A(t_1[\SUBsFORy{m}],...t_n[\SUBsFORy{m}])}}  & \Imapsto & \clausethreelhs \\ [0.4cm]
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
and therefore to establish (\ref{clauseiiirequiredmapping}) we need to show that
\begin{equation*}
\clausethreelhs = \clausethreerhs										
\end{equation*}
This we can do by repeated application of identities (\ref{metagattriplestar})
and (\ref{metagatcrossstarcross}), which are two of the meta-GAT axioms described earlier.\\
\end{newtt}

\underline{CF2(b)} By this principle, from a operator symbol $f$ with introductory rule $r_f$ of the form \gatdisplayrule[,]{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{f(\xn)}{\Delta}} for some $n \geq 0$, if
$P$ is a context and if in particular the rule $r_P$ asserting that $P$ is a context is a derived rule of $U$
and from derived rules $r_{t_i}$ of the form \ItDelta[P]{i}, \foreachi, we may deduce
the rule \gatdisplayrule{P}{\ofT{f(t_1,...t_n)}{\Delta[\SUBtFORx{n}]}}, which we shall denote by $r$, is a derived rule of $U$. 
\tbd \\

\underline{SI1} 
This principle states that if \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\Omega=\Omega'} is a derived rule, if $Q$ is a context and if  $\sm$ and $\smp$ are expressions such that
\foreachj, \gatdisplayrule{Q}{s_j=s'_j \in \Omega\SUBsFORy{j-1}} is a derived rule then we may derive the rule
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]=\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}. \\

We have to show that this latter rule is consistently intepreted by $\Ibar$ \highlight{CHECK} from the assumption that each of the rules \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\Omega=\Omega'} and
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{s_j=s'_j \in \Omega\SUBsFORy{j-1}}, \foreachj, are consistently intepreted by $\Ibar$.

To do this we have to show that the rules \ZOmegaSUBsmFORym and \gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}}
are consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ and that
$$
\ibarmappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}} = \ibarmappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}}.
$$
From the assumptions that we have made and from the definition of what it means for a rule to be consistently interpreted it follows that
each of the rules
\ZOmega
and
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega'}}
and each of the rules
\IsOmega{j}
and
\gatdisplayrule[,]{Q}{\sjpconclusion}
\foreachj, are consistently intepreted by $\Ibar$. Therefore from lemma \lref{substitutioninterpretationlemma} 
the first part of what we have to prove, that the rules \ZOmegaSUBsmFORym and \gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}}
are consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$, follows.
Finally we can show that
$$
\ibarmappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}} = \ibarmappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}}.
$$.

\begin{newtt}
$$ \gmstar...\gonestar(\crossx{a}{\ibarmappedrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{s}{\Omega}}}{1})$$
where \foreachj, $g_j$ is the section
$\displaystyle\Imappedrule{Q}{ \ofT{s_j}{\Omega_j \SUBsFORy{j-1}}}$
and where $a$ is the object to which $I$ maps context $Q$.

\end{newtt}

because  from the the fact  that \ZOmegaSUBsmFORym is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$ we have that
$$
\Imappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega[\SUBsFORy{m}]}} = \gmstar...\gonestar(\crossx{a}{\Imappedrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega}}}{1})
$$
where \foreachj, $g_j$ is the section
$\displaystyle\Imappedrule{Q}{ \ofT{s_j}{\Omega_j \SUBsFORy{j-1}}}$
and where $a$ is the object to which $\Ibar$ maps context $Q$,
and similarly we have that
$$
\ibarmappedrule{Q}{\isT{\Omega'[s'_1|y_1...s'_m|y_m]}} = \gprimemstar...\gprimeonestar(\crossx{a}{\Imappedrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega'}}}{1})
$$

where, \foreachj,  
$g_j$ is the section 
and $g'_j$ is the section 
and because \foreachj, $g_j=g'_j$ from the assumption
that rule \gatdisplayrule{Q}{s_j=s'_j \in \Omega\SUBsFORy{j-1}} is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$
and since
$$
\ibarmappedrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega}} = \ibarmappedrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega'}}
$$
from the assumption that \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\Omega=\Omega'} is consistently interpreted by $\Ibar$.

This principle states that if \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{s = s' \in \Omega} is a derived rule, if $Q$ is a context and if  $\sm$ and $\smp$ are expressions such that
