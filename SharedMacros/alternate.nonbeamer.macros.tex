% This file contains implmentation of macros that are also implmented in

% i.e. for non-presentations i.e. for papers.

% Commands to control level of detail in pictures
\newcounter{levelofdetail}
\newcommand{\waitfor}[2]{\ifnum #1 > \value{levelofdetail} \else #2 \fi}
% Setting a high number for level of detail shows most detail
\setcounter{levelofdetail}{10}
% In presentations waitfor is implemented using onslide as follows
%\renewcommand{\waitfor}[2]{\onslide<#1->{#2}} 
%Because of this outside of a waitfor level of detail is 1
% frist level programmed with waitfor should be level 2
