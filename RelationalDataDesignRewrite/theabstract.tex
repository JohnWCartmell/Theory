We present a formal framework for database specification that generalises  both Codd's relational data model and the post-Chen binary-relationship style entity relationship modelling (ER modelling) implemented, for instance, in Oracle's SQL developer tool and  described in the book of Barker.  We generalise the definitions of the most significant database normal forms (3NF, EKNF, IN-NF, 4NF, 5NF) and prove that from a well-formulated logical ER model there corresponds a relational model which is fully normalised. We conclude that the normalisation step in top-down relational data design is unnecessary.
