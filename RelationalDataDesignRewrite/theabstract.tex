We present a formal notion of data specification that generalises  both Codd's relational data model and the post-Chen binary-relationship style entity relationship modelling (ER modelling) implemented, for instance, in Oracle's SQL developer tool and  described in the book of Barker.  We generalise the definitions of some database normal forms (3NF, EKNF, IN-NF) and prove that from a well-formulated logical ER model there corresponds a relational model which is fully normalised. We conclude that the normalisation step in top-down relational data design is unnecessary.  In doing so we provide a theoretical foundation for the elimination of the normalisation step from the relational design workflow and  shift  emphasis,to goodness criteria for  a certain style of extended entity relationship model. This version of the paper covers 
Elementary Key Normal Form (EKNF), and therefore Third Normal Form (3NF), and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).
