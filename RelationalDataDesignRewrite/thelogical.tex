I am using the term \term{logical} in the sense that it is used in certain ER modelling methodolgies such as ???.
\subsection{Fully Factored Models}

\begin{definition}
In an entity model $\gmodel$ if $a$ is an entity type then say that
a \term{factorisation} of the set $I_a$ is a subset $\set{h_1,...h_n} \subset I_a$ \commentary{why not
$\set{h_1,...h_n} \subseteq I_a$?}
and a  path $f:a \morph b$ and a set of paths sourced at $b$, $\set{g_1,...g_n} \in \bar{I}$\commentary{not defined}
such that for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, $f \circ g_i \simeq h_i$. 
\end{definition}

The factorisation consists  
of a base set of edges: $h=I \backslash \set{h_1,...h_n}$, a mediating path $f:a \morph b$ and a remainder 
set $j$ paths sourced at $b$, $j \in \bar{I}$, 
such that $I_a \simeq h \cup \setsuchthat{f\circ g}{g \in j}$.


\subsection{Definition of Logical ER Model}
\begin{definition}
A well-formulated ER model is \term{purely-logical}  iff it 
also satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item
for all edges $r$ if there is a
a simple path $p$  not including $r$ such that
 $r \simeq p$  then $r$ is identifying and there is an edge $e$ in $p$ which is not identifying,
\item the set of identifying sets I of the model is fully-factored.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{definition}

\noindent
We say that an ER model is a \term{logical ER model} iff it is purely logical.

\subsection{Factorisation}
\begin{definition}
If $\gmodel$ is a model and if there is a factorisation at entity type $a$ with
base set $h$, mediating path $f: a \morph b$ and remainder $j \in \bar{I}$ then define
a factored model $\gmodel'$ determined by the factorisation to be the model
whose underlying graph is the graph of $\gmodel$ with edges $h_1,...h_n$ removed 
(defining database instances restricted) and an edge $\lqq{f}$ added, $\lqq{f}:a \morph b$, each database instance $E$ extends to $E'$, $E'_{\lqq{f}} = E_f$.
Identifying sets of $\gmodel'$ are exactly as for $\gmodel$ except for at the entity
type $a$ where the identifying set $I_a$ in $\gmodel'$ is defined to be $h \cup \set{k}$.
Note that by lemma \ref{identifyingsetdeduction} the modified $E'$ is a database instance because the family 
$\setsuchthat{E'_e}{e \in \set{h \cup \set{\lqq{f}}}}$ is jointly injective because 
$\setsuchthat{E'_e}{e \in \set{h \cup \set{\lqq{f}}}} =\setsuchthat{E_e}{e \in \set{h \cup \set{f}}}$
and in model $\gmodel$, $h \cup \set{f}$ is a mono-source because both
$h \cup \set{f} \backslash f \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}
=h  \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}=I_a$ and $j$ are  mono-sources.


\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $a$ is an entity type in an entity model $\gmodel$ then define the abstraction
level of $a$ to be the sum of the lengths of the primary key paths sourced at $a$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
Define  the abstraction level of a model $\gmodel$ to be
the sum over all entity types $a$ of the abstraction level of $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
If $\gmodel'$ is a factorisation of model $\gmodel$ then abstraction level 
of $\gmodel'$ is greater than abstraction level of $\gmodel$ and the number of edges
is not increased. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
Define an entity model $\gmodel$ to be fully-factored iff there no entity types $a$
for which the set $I_a$ has  factorisations.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
If $\gmodel$ is a model then say that a $\gmodel'$ is a fully-factored 
equivalent to $\gmodel$
if it results from successive factorisations of $\gmodel$ until the resulting model can no longer be
factorised. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
Every model $\gmodel$ has a fully factorised equivalent. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We need to show that the factorisation process will terminate. 
to do this note that we can put a (crude) bound on the abstraction level of an entity model
of number of entity types multiplied by the square of the  number of edges
\commentary{Need revise this most likely}.  Because the number of nodes remains constant during
factorisation and because the number of edges does not increase this bound can be calculated
for the model $\gmodel$ and serves as an upper bound for the abstraction level of 
any successive factorisation of $\gmodel$. Since factorisation increases abstraction level
and there is an upper bound to abstraction level then the process cannot continue indefinitely. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Minimality Condition of Factored Model}

\begin{lemma}
\label{identifyingfactorminimal}
In a model $\gmodel$, if $i$ is a source with domain $a$,
if $f \in i$, $f: a \morph b$, 
and if $j$ is a mono-source with domain $b$
then  if $(i \backslash \set{f}) \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}$ is a minimum mono-source
then $i$ is a minimum mono-source.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We assume that $(i \backslash \set{f}) \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}$ is a mono-source and that no subset of it is a mono-source.
By lemma \ref{identifyingsetdeduction} it follows that $i$ is a mono-source we need to show that
for no edge $e \in i$ is $i \backslash \set{e}$ a mono source. Assume to the contrary that there is such an $e$ then  either $e = f$ or else
$e \in i \backslash \set{f}$. In the first case $(i \backslash \set{f})$ is a subset of  $(i \backslash \set{f}) \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}$ which is a mono-source which contradicts the initial assumption. In the second  case 
by lemma \ref{identifyingsetdeduction} since $i \backslash \set{e}$ is a mono-source it follows that
$((i \backslash \set{e})\backslash \set{f}) \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}$ is a mono-source which again is to say that a subset
of $(i \backslash \set{f}) \cup \setsuchthat{f \circ g}{g \in j}$ is a mono-source contradicting the initial assumption.
We conclude that no subset of $i$ is a mono-source.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
If a model $\gmodel$ satisfies the minimality condition then it has a fully factored
equivalent $\gmodel'$  and $\gmodel'$ satisfies the minimality condition. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By lemma \ref{identifyingfactorminimal} we have the minimality of $I_a$ in $\gmodel'$.

To show that representative sets of primary key paths in $\gmodel'$ are minimal mono-sources
first note that to each path $p'$ in $\gmodel'$ there is a corresponding path 
$p$ in $\gmodel$  
 such that for all instances $E$ of $\gmodel$ with corresponding $E'$ of $\gmodel'$, 
$E_p=E'_{p'}$ and that this correspondence establishes a 1-1 correspondence between the set of primary key paths $P'$ in $\gmodel'$
and the set of primary key paths $P'$ in $\gmodel$. Because $E_p=E'_{p'}$, for all defining instances
$E$, it follows that a representative set for $P'$ corresponds to a representative set for $P'$ and also
that mono-sources in $\gmodel'$ correspond to mono-sources in $\gmodel$. From this it follows that representative sets of primary key paths in $\gmodel'$ are minimal mono-sources.
\end{proof}
