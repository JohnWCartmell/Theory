\note
We give the broadest possible notion of a model
of a generalised algebraic theory \gat[U] by defining the notion of an interpretation of  \gat[U] in  any given contextual category \catc.

\note
First, as a stepping stone, we need  give an auxillary definition, the definition of  a `preinterpretation of \gat[U] in \catc'.

\newcommand{\Isort}{I_{sort}}
\newcommand{\Iop}{I_{op}}
\note 
If \gat[U] is a generalised algebraic theory  and if \catcw is a contextual category then
a preinterpretation $I$ of  \gat[U] in \catcw consists of a pair :
\begin{itemize}
\item a mapping $\Isort$ that maps each sort symbol of \gat[U] to  an object of \catc,
\item a mapping $\Iop$ that maps each operator symbol of \gat[U] to a section of \catcw (i.e. to a morphism $f: A \morph B$ for some 
$A \base B$ in \catcw such that $f \circ p_B=id_A$).
\end{itemize}

\note 
An interpretation $I$ of \gat[U] in \catcw is a preinterpretation satisfying additional conditions and these 
additional conditions imply that the preinterpretation induces a mapping $\hat{I}$
of derived T- and $\epsilon$- rules of \gat[U] to objects, respectively sections, of \gat[U] such that 
all equational identities of \gat[U] are respected in the sense that :
\begin{itemize}
\item whenever 
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{t = t' \in \Delta}$
is an axiom/derived rule of \gat[U] then $\hat{I}(R) = \hat{I}(R')$
where $R$ is the rule
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}$
and $R'$ is the rule
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{\ofT{t'}{\Delta}}$,
\item whenever
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{\Delta = \Delta'}$
is an axiom/derived rule of \gat[U] then $\hat{I}(R) = \hat{I}(R')$
where $R$ is the rule
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{\isT{\Delta}}$
and $R'$ is the rule
$\frac{\context{x}{\Delta}{n}}{\isT{\Delta}}$.
\end{itemize}
