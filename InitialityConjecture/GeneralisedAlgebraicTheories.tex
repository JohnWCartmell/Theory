\note
We give the broadest possible notion of a model
of a generalised algebraic theory \gatUw by defining the notion of an interpretation of  \gatUw in  any given contextual category \catc.

\note Aside: Simple weakening. We can prove that in any generalised algebraic theory $\gatU$ that
if $Q$ is any context,
and if the rule \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{Conclusion} is a derived rule of \gatUw then
the (weakened) rule \gatdisplayrule{Q,\yOmega{m}}{Conclusion} is a derived rule of \gatU.
\note 
An interpretation $I$ of \gatUw in \catcw is a  mapping 
of derived T- and $\in$- rules of \gatUw to objects, respectively sections, of \gatUw that satisfies the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\setlength\itemindent{2cm}
\item \underline{\textbf{T-rules}} 
Suppose that  the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta}} is a derived rule of \gatUw which is mapped by $I$ to an object $a$ of \catc. Denote this rule $r$. Recall that because $r$ is a derived rule then it follows  that for each $i$, 
$1 \leq i \leq n$, the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{i-1}}{\isT{\Delta_i}} is a derived rule of \gatU. Let $r_i$ denote this rule.
Suppose that $I$ maps each rule $r_i$ to an object $a_i$ of \catcw.
It is required that $1 \base a_1 \base ... \base a_n \base a$ in \catc.

Suppose that the  expression $\Delta$ is exactly the expression $\Delta_i$, for some $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$. In this special case we require that the rule $r$  is mapped by $I$ to the object 
$\crossx{a_n}{a_i}{a_{i-1}}$. 

\item \underline{\textbf{$\boldsymbol {\in}$-rules}} 
In addition to the assumptions made in (i),  suppose that the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} is a  derived rule of \gatU. 
Denote this rule $r_t$. It is required that $I$ maps the rule $r_t$ to a section
 $s:a_n \morph a$ in \catcw i.e. to a morphism $s:a_n \morph a$ such that $s \circ p_a = id_{a_n}$. 

Suppose that the  expression $\Delta$ is exactly the expression $\Delta_i$, for some $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ and that the expression $t_i$ is simply the variable $x_i$. 
In this special case we require that the rule $r_t$  is mapped by $I$ to the section\footnote{
With these assumptions, $s(p_{a_n,a_i}): a_n \morph \crossx{a_n}{a_i}{a_{i-1}}$ in \catcw because by definition  $s(p_{a_n,a_i}): a_n  \morph (p_{a_n,a_i} \circ p_{a_i})^*a_i$,
and we have 
\begin{align*}
(p_{a_n,a_i} \circ p_{a_i})^*a_i &= {p_{a_n,a_{i-1}}} ^* a_i  && \mbox{ because $p_{a_n,a_i} \circ p_{a_i}=p_{a_n,a_{i-1}}$,} \\
                                 &= \crossx{a_n}{a_i}{a_{i-1}} && \mbox{ by definition of $\crossx{}{}{w}$}.
\end{align*}
} % end footnote
$s(p_{a_n,a_i})$ of the object $\crossx{a_n}{a_i}{a_{i-1}}$. 

\item \underline{\textbf{T=-rules}} 
In addition to the assumptions made in (i), suppose that  
the rule \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\Delta = \Delta'} is a derived rule of \gatU. 
We may deduce that the
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta'}} is a derived rule of \gatU. Denote this latter rule $r'$.
It is required that the rule $r'$ is mapped by $I$ to the same object $a$ of \catcw that $r$ is mapped to.

\item \underline{\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\in=}$-rules}} 
In addition to the assumptions made in (ii),  suppose that the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{t = t' \in \Delta}
is a derived rule of \gatU. We may deduce that the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{t'}{\Delta}} is a  derived rule of \gatU. 
Denote this latter rule $r'_t$.
It is required that the rule $r'_t$ is mapped by $I$ to the same section $s$ of $a$ that $r_t$ is mapped to.

\item \underline{\textbf{weakening T-rules}} 
Suppose now that $Q$ is any context of \gatUw and that the rule 
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega}} is a derived rule of \gatU. Denote this rule $r_\Omega$. 
It follows that \foreachj, the rule   \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}}{\isT{\Omega_j}} is a derived rule of \gatU. Denote this rule $r_{\Omega_j}$.
Suppose that each rule $r_{\Omega_j}$ is mapped by $I$ to an object $b_j$ of \catcw and that rule $r_\Omega$ is mapped by $I$ to an object $b$ of \catcw so that
we have that $b_1 \base ... \base b_m \base b$ in \catc.

By the simple weakening lemma it follows that the rules
\gatdisplayrule{Q, \yOmega{j-1}}{\isT{\Omega_j}}, \foreachj, and 
\gatdisplayrule{Q, \yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega}} are  derived rule of \gatU. It is required that these rules are mapped by $I$ to the objects
$\crossx{a}{b_1}{1},...\crossx{a}{b_m}{1}$ and to $\crossx{a}{b}{1}$, respectively. 

\item \underline{\textbf{weakening $\boldsymbol {\in}$-rules}} 
Suppose in addition that the rule \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{s}{\Omega}} is a derived rule of \gatUw 
and that this rule is mapped by $I$ to a section $g$ of object $b$ in \catc.
By the simple weakening lemma it follows that the rule \gatdisplayrule{Q, \yOmega{m}}{\ofT{s}{\Omega}}
is a derived rule of \gatU. It is required that this rule is mapped by $I$ to the section $\crossx{a}{s}{1}$
of object $\crossx{a}{b}{1}$ of \catc.


\item \underline{\textbf{substituting in T-rules}} 
Suppose that, as in (v), above, the rule 
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Omega}} is a derived rule of \gatU.
We may deduce that \foreachj, the rule   \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}}{\isT{\Omega_j}} is a derived rule of \gatU. 
Suppose that, as in (v), these rules are mapped by $I$ to objects $b_1,...b_n$ and $b$ so that
we have  $b_1 \base ... \base b_m \base b$ in \catc. Now suppose that for some $j$, $1 \leq j \leq m$, the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}}{\ofT{t}{\Omega_j}} is a derived rule of \gatU. 
Now it follows by the substitution lemma that for each $j'$, $j < j' \leq m$ the rule

\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}, y_{j+1}\in \Omega_{j+1}[t|y_j],... y_{j'-1} \in \Omega_{j'-1}[t|y_j] }{\isT{\Omega_j[t|y_j]}} is a derived rule of \gatUw and that likewise the rule

\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}, y_{j+1}\in \Omega_{j+1}[t|y_j],... y_m \in \Omega_m[t|y_j] }{\isT{\Omega}[t|y_j]} is a derived rule of \gatU.
It is required that these rules are mapped by $I$ to objects $f^*b_{j+1},...f^*b_m$ and $f^*b$, respectively.
Note that as required we have that $f^*b_{j+1}\base ... \base f^*b_m \base f^*b$ in \catc.

\item \underline{\textbf{substituting in $\boldsymbol {\in}$-rules}} 
Suppose that in addition to the situation in (vii), above, the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{s}{\Omega}}
is a derived rule of \gatUw and suppose that this rule is mapped to a section $g$ of object $b$ of \catc.
Now it follows by the substitution lemma that the rule
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{j-1}, y_{j+1}\in \Omega_{j+1}[t|y_j],... y_m \in \Omega_m[t|y_j]}{\ofT{s[t|y_j]}{\Omega[t|y_j]}} 
is a derived rule of \gatU.
It is a requirement that this rule is mapped by $I$ to the section $f^*g$ of object $f^*b$ of \catc.
\end{enumerate}


\note
We can show that an interpretation $I$ of a contextual category \gatUw in a contextual category \catCw is
completely determined by its mapping of the introductory rules of sort symbols and operator symbols to
objects, respectively, sections of \catc. In order to show this first define a preinterpretation as follows:
\begin{definition}
If \gatU is a generalised algebraic theory  and if \catcw is a contextual category then
a \term{preinterpretation} $I$ of  \gatU in \catcw consists of a pair :
\begin{itemize}
\item a mapping $\Isort$ that maps each sort symbol of \gatUw to  an object of \catc,
\item a mapping $\Iop$ that maps each operator symbol of \gatUw to a section of \catcw (i.e. to a morphism $f: A \morph B$ for some 
$A \base B$ in \catcw such that $f \circ p_B=id_A$).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
A preinterpretation will unqiuely extend to an interpretation (we will say it is an interpretation) iff it is type correct but being precise about what we mean by type correct requires a minor detour. 

\note The definition of $\Ihat$ from $\Isort$ and $\Iop$ whnever $I$ is an interpretation proceeds by induction 
on the derivation of rules in  \gatUw 
as described in the principles of derivation in Definition 2(b) of \cite{Cartmell86}. 
The only non-trivial parts of this definition relate to the rules
identified as CF1, CF2(a) and CF2(b)\footnote{So identified, by the way, as a mnemonic for cut-free.}. We consider each of these rules in turn.

\begin{point}
Rule CF1 states that for $n \geq 0$, for $1 \leq i \leq n+1$, from the derived rule 
$\frac{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta_{n+1}}}$ which we shall denote $R$ 
we may derive the rule
$\frac{\xDelta{n+1}}{\ofT{x_i}{\Delta_i}}$ which, in turn, we shall denote $R_{x_i}$.
Define $\Ihat(R_{x_i}) :  \Ihat(R) \morph \crossx{\Ihat(R)}{\Ihat(R_i)}{\Ihat(R_{i-1})}$
to be $\tuple{p_{\Ihat(R),\Ihat(R_{i-1})},p_{\Ihat(R),\Ihat(R_{i})}}$. 

This presumably is $s(p_{\Ihat(R),\Ihat(R_{i-1})})$ where $s$ is Vladimir's s-operator.
\end{point}
\begin{point}
CF2(a) states that if $A$ is a sort symbol introduced by
$\frac{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{A(\xn)}}$ 
and if $P$ is a context and $\tn$ are expressions then from the following rules, which we shall denote $R_{t_1}$,..$R_{t_n}$,
$\frac{P}{\ofT{t_1}{\Delta_1}}$,
$\frac{P}{\ofT{t_2}{\Delta_2[t_1|x_1]}}$,
... and 
$\frac{P}{\ofT{t_n}{\Delta_n[t_1|x_1,...t_{n-1}|x_{n-1}]}}$
we may derive the rule
$\frac{P}{\isT{A(t_1,...t_n)}}$ which we denote as $R$. 
Define $I(R)$ to be $\Ihat(R_n)^*...\Ihat(R_1)^*\crossx{\Ihat(R_n)}{I(A)}{1}$.\commentary{check this}

\note 3
\label{omegarealisationwrtQ}
 Suppose also that $\encyOmega{m}$ is a context of generalised algebraic theory \gatUw and suppose that $Q$ is some other context and that for some $m \geq 1$,
 \foreachj, \gatdisplayrule{Q}{\ofT{s_j}{\Omega_j[s_1|y_1,...s_{j-1}|y_{j-1}]}} is a derived rule of \gatU\footnote{Recall that such an m-tuple $\tuple{\sm}$ is said to be a realisation of 
$\encyOmega{m}$ wrt $Q$.}.  Suppose that an interpretation $I$ of \gatUw in a contextual category \catcw maps the context $Q$ to an object $a$  of $\catc$ and maps
the context $\encyOmega{j}$ to an object $b_j$ of \catc, \foreachj, so that $1 \base b_1 ... \base b_m$ in \catc. In this situation the rule 
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\ofT{s_1}{\Omega_1}} will be mapped by $I$ to some section $f_1:a \morph \crossx{a}{b_1}{1}$. The j'th rule,
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\ofT{s_j}{\Omega_j[s_1|y_1,...s_{j-1}|y_{j-1}]}}, will be mapped to a section $f_j:a \morph \fjpstar ... \fonestar\crossx{a}{b_j}{1}$.
In the case that $m=3$  then in \catcw we will have objects and morphisms as follows:

\note 
How suppose that additional to the situation of para. \ref{omegarealisationwrtQ} the rules 
\gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\isT{\Delta}} and  \gatdisplayrule{\yOmega{m}}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}} are derived rules of \gatUw. 
Let us denote these rules $r$ and $r_t$, respectively. Suppose that $I$ is an interpretation of $\gatUw$ in \catcw as mapping rules and contexts as described in para. \ref{omegarealisationwrtQ}.
From what we have said in para \ref{omegarealisationwrtQ}, the interpretation  $I$ will map rule $r$ to an object $b$ such that ${b_m \base b}$ in \catcw and it will map the rule $r_t$ to a section $g:b_m \morph b$.  

Now it follows by the substitution lemma (see \cite{Cartmell86})
that the substituted $r$ and $r_t$ rules: 
\gatdisplayrule{Q}{\isT{\Delta[s_1|y_1...s_m|y_m]}} 
and  \gatdisplayrule{Q}{\ofT{t[s_1|y_1...s_m|y_m]}{\Delta[s_1|y_1...s_m|y_m]}} are derived rules of \gatU. 

\highlight{We require that}
the substituted $r$ rule will be mapped by $I$ to the object $\smstar...\sonestar\crossx{a}{b}{1}$ and the substituted $r_t$ rule will
be mapped by $I$ to the morphism  $\smstar...\sonestar\crossx{a}{g}{1}$ (which is defined since $g$ is a section).
