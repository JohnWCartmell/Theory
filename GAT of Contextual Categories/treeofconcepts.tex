\subsection {Trees of Concepts and the GAT of Trees}



\note 
Terminology: By  the generic term \term{tree} is meant a partially ordered set (poset) $(T, <)$ such that for each $t \in T$, the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$ is well-ordered by the relation $<$.
In this discussion we restrict ourselves to \highlight{$\omega$-trees} i.e. trees for which the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$
is finite for all $t \in T$. If the set $\set{s \in T : s < t}$ is empty then we say $t$ is in the base of the tree.

With respect to a partial ordering $<$, we say that \highlight{an element $y$ \textit{covers}  an element $x$} in  iff $x<y$ and there does not exist $w$ such that $x < w$ and $w < y$.
If object $y$ covers object $x$ in the partial ordering 
then we write \highlight{$x \base y$} (we use this in preference to the more usual $x \lessdot y$).
For $x$ an element of the tree we define the set of elements  \highlight{$Cover(x)$} to be the set of objects covering $x$.


Such trees as these we can equivalently describe as models of the generalised algebraic theory given below table \ref{GATOFTREES} in which the nodes of height $n+1$ are represented as of a sort $S_{n+1}$that is dependent on the sort of nodes of height $n$.

If A and B are nodes of  a tree $(S,<)$ then we shall write $A \base B$ to mean that $A < B$ in S and that
there does not exist x such that $A < x < B$. For every node B of tree S other than the root node there exists a unique node A such that $A \base B$.

There is a  shorthand that is convenient in the presentation  of the GAT of trees  and then subsequently in the GAT of contextual categories. We use the shorthand
$\ofTn{x}{n}{\genericOb}$ for the context $\ofS{x_0},\ofSi{x_1}{1}{x_0}, \hdots \ofSi{x_n}{n}{x_0,x_1,\hdots x_{n-1}} $. \\

\noindent Using this shorthand, for any $n \geq 0$ the sort $Cover_{n}$  in the theory of trees is introduced as follows: \\

\vspace{0.03cm} 
\begin{tabular}{>{\itshape}l l}
Symbol & \itshape{Introductory Rule} \\
$\Sz  $     & $\isT{\Sz}$\\
$\Si{n+1}, n \geq 0 $ & $\ofTn{x}{n}{\genericOb}    \tstyle \isT{\Si{n+1}(x)} $\\
\end{tabular} \\
\vspace{.1cm}  \\


\subsection {An Aside on Recursive Type Definitions}

Using the shorthand, we are quite close to having a recursive definition of a single sort $Cover$.
Such definitions are not possible in generalised algebraic theories but we can imagine a framework in which it is possible to write: \\
\vspace{0.03cm} 
\begin{tabular}{>{\itshape}l l}
Symbol & \itshape{Introductory Rule} \\
$Base $     & $\isT{Base}$\\
$Cover  $     & $\ofT{x_0}{Base}    \tstyle \isT{Cover(x_0)} $\\
$Cover $      & $\ofT{x}{Cover}    \tstyle \isT{Cover(x)} $\\
\end{tabular} \\
\vspace{.1cm}  \\

Such a definition could be represented algebraically in a suitably generalised notion of contextual category (a comulti-contextual category?) these dependencies could be represented
as follows:  

\begin{center}
$
\begin{array}{c c}
\Rnode{abs}{1}  \\ [1.4cm]
\Rnode{S0}{Base} \\ [1.4cm]
\Rnode{SR}{Cover} \\ [1.4cm]
\end{array}
$
\ncsar{S0}{abs}
\ncsar{SR}{S0}
\ncrsar{SR}{SR}
\end{center}

\noindent This is not just an idle thought -- in  data modelling such a tree 
structure is represented in an entity model diagram in which the injections into the coproduct $Ob$ of $Base$ and $Cover$ are represented by containment: \\
