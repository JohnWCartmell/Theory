# Theory

The latex source for papers that I am working on.

* GAT of Contextual Categories - the generalised algebraic theory of contextual categories.
* Generalised Algebaric Meta Theory - the generalised algebraic theory of generalised algebaric theories.
* Introduction To Types That Vary.
* Notation - About the latex macros used in these papers.
* Soundness of Ellipsis within Generalised Algebraic Theories - part solution to a problem from 1978.
* Unification in the presence of sequence variables - documentation of unification algorithm intended for rewriting theory of contextual categories. Sadly  it turned out I couldn't get to a Church-Rosser stykle rewrite system as I had hoped.
