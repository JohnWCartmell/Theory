# Theory

The latex source for papers that I am working on.

Worthy of public view:


* GAT of Contextual Categories - the generalised algebraic theory of contextual categories.
* Generalised Algebaric Meta Theory - the generalised algebraic theory of generalised algebaric theories.
* Introduction To Types That Vary - an attempt at a general purpose introduction.
* Relational Data Design Part One - I have been thinking about this most of my workinbg life. This comes together in the MathematicalTheoryOfData.
* Mathematical Theory Of Data - This started life as Relational Data Design Part Two but actually is bigger than that.
* Soundness of Ellipsis within Generalised Algebraic Theories - part solution to a problem from 1978.

Private notes:
* Contextual Category et al Literature Review
* Database Literature Review
* Project on Definitions of Contextual Categories - a project that hasn't got very far.
* Notation - About the latex macros used in these papers.
* Unification in the presence of sequence variables - documentation of unification algorithm intended to be sutiable for rewriting theory of contextual categories. The method is sound but it doesn't soplve the problem i wanted it to -- I couldn't achieve a church-rosser style rewrite system dfor contextual categories.
