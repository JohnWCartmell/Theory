# Theory

The latex source for papers that I am working on.

Worthy of public view:


* GAT of Contextual Categories - the generalised algebraic theory of contextual categories.
* Generalised Algebaric Meta Theory - the generalised algebraic theory of generalised algebaric theories.
* Introduction To Types That Vary - an attempt at a general purpose introduction.
* Relational Data Design Part One - I have been thinking about this most of my working life. This comes together in the MathematicalTheoryOfData.
* Mathematical Theory Of Data - This started life as Relational Data Design Part Two but actually is bigger than that.
* Dependency Categories - Under this new name this paper is intended to correct my 1986 description of network categories. 
   Dependency categories are to be a variation on the notion of contextual category in that  the category of dependency categories, 
    as defined here, is to be shown equivalent to the category of (?cancellative?) contextual categories. 
   As in 1986 the motivation has been to formalise and foreground the network structure of type dependencies so as to provide a 
   theoretical foundation for the use of networks of composition relationships in entity modelling as applied both conceptually and, 
   for the most practical of purposes, in systems development.
* Soundness of Ellipsis within Generalised Algebraic Theories - part solution to a problem from 1978.

Private notes:
* Contextual Category et al Literature Review
* Database Literature Review
* Project on Definitions of Contextual Categories - a project that hasn't got very far.
* Notation - About the latex macros used in these papers.
* Unification in the presence of sequence variables - documentation of unification algorithm intended to be sutiable for rewriting theory of contextual categories. 
                                                    The method is sound but it doesn't solve the problem I wanted it to in that I couldn't achieve a church-rosser 
													style rewrite system for contextual categories.
