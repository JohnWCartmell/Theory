\subsection{\cite{Johnson93}      }
Having define a directed graph in which nodes are either types of entity or
else attributes and the edges are functional (many-one) relationships
they argue that there is a composition structure on this graph
and that the resulting category should be thought of as a classifying category
for the ER-model (there is no technical meaning to this term classifying category by the way, 
the term is used descriptively):
\begin{quote}
Since the many-to-one relations in the
model are intended to represent real world many-to-one relations (functions)
there are real world compositions and we argue that these should be represented
in the model. Many of the compositions are free in the sense that formal 
composites can just be added to the model (or indeed left out since such formality
can be added later), but when there is a closed loop of arrows it is important to
determine, by considering the real world semantics, whether the diagram commutes. 
Once this has been done for all possible composites we have constructed
a classifying category for the ER-model.
\end{quote}

Now for the good bit - as true today as when they wrote it twenty five years ago:
\begin{quote}
It is remarkable that extant ER-modelling methodologies have ignored this
question of commuting diagrams. Typically an analyst spends a great deal of
time and effort developing a model and eventually passes it to a programmer
to implement. Often it is important that the resultant program check the 
constraint implied by the commutativity of certain diagrams, but since the analyst
has not recorded which diagrams commute it is up to the less experienced 
programmer to try to reconstruct the intended semantics and to decide whether a
given diagram should commute!
\end{quote}

Next the authors state that certain additional \textit{exactness properties} are required of the category
- no rationale for this at this point:
\begin{quote}
We need a terminal object I, 
and arrows $I \morph A$ will be used to specify instances of the entity A. We
need finite coproducts for two reasons. First, entities often have substructure
which is best indicated by coproducts (so for example in a small retail 
business the entity EMPLOYEE might be the coproduct of the entities DRIVER,
SALESPERSON, CLERICAL STAFF and MANAGEMENT). Secondly, attributes
are fixed sets (so for example PRODUCT NO might be the set of all four digit
numbers -- of course most of these numbers won't be used at any particular point
in time, but the relationship between PRODUCT and PRODUCT NO allows us
to see which ones are currently valid product numbers). Thus attributes are
usually $\sum^nI $ for some n (n = 10000 in our product numbers example). This
is technically very important since the injection $i_k:I \morph \sum^nI$  allows us to
pick out attribute number k from which, if the attribute is a key attribute, we
can obtain information about a particular instance of the corresponding entity.

Finally we need pullbacks, both to allow us to compose relations and to allow
us to access the entity instances with particular attribute values.

Furthermore we expect the coproducts to behave well. They should be
disjoint and universal. Thus in the presence of pullbacks and a 
terminal object
we expect our classifying category to be a \textit{lextensive category} [2] [[Replace this by a citation of my own]].
\end{quote}
Finally, they add that:
\begin{quote}
we expect subobjects to be complemented with I + I acting as
a subobject classifier. 
\end{quote}
and note that an extensive category with this property is called a
\textit{Boolean category} and is necessarily lextensive. 
They note that
\begin{quote}
 the internal logic of the lextensive
classifying category of an information model forms a query language for that
model. Thus the standard queries arise as objects of the classifying category.

The semantics of the information model will be given by lextensive functors
from its classifying category to set. Such functors will necessarily carry the
object representing a query to the set of records which satisfy the query.
\end{quote}
Now we are at the heart of the matter. By the way your can contrast this by my 1985 paper where I am interested in queries that can
be executed in O(log n) time, where n is number of instances involved in the query. The idea there is that there is a lesser
categorical structure which encapsulates there more performant queries which in turn are directly supported by the database structure.
(Remember what telephone directories looked like - open one that has perversely ordered by telephone number instead of by name -
how long will it take to find the number you are looking for - does this distinguish between data (its there somewhere) and information
(its there and I know how to quickly find it).  


I disagree with the following:
\begin{quote}
in order to update the information system, it is usually necessary to
update an instance at each vertex of the diagram and then finally to check that
commutativity has been preserved
\end{quote}
because commutativity should be built into the information content.

\begin{quote}
One particularly difficult problem in dealing with large information systems
is the presentation of different views of the system for different users. The
problem is essentially one of how to partition the system so that users can see
a relatively complete view related to the aspects that are of relevance to them
without having to look at the whole system. The recognition of commuting
diagrams as processes suggests that the best partitioning would be obtained
by choosing a related group of commutative diagrams. This will be developed
in work currently in progress. An early example is shown in Figure 8 where
four views of an information model have been derived by selecting commuting
diagrams from a much larger and more detailed model.
\end{quote}
This is because commuting diagrams indicate locality. Hence composition relationships!

Regarding the above description of coproducts as inheritance: I suggest could model this categorically by adding that
there are canonical coproducts (or at least can be presented canonically) and that all objects are domain to at most
one cannonical injection. Then it follows that for each  morphism $1 \morph A$ in the presentation there is a an object
$A_a$ and a cannonical injection $A_a \morph A$ which represents $a$ as a singular subtype of $A$. We can claim that
$A_a$, and, by association, $a$, are universals. 

Bertrand Russell\footnote{Problems of philosophy, page 59 in 1967 edition} in consideration of the proposition
that `two and two are four' is of the view that this proposition:
\begin{quote}
...states a relationship between the universal `two' and the universal `four'.
\end{quote}
and from which he `endeavours to establish':
\begin{quote}
\textit{All} a priori \textit{knowledge deals exclusively with the relations of universals.}
\end{quote}

Discussion of overloading of the term`model'.
Introduction of the term `EA-sketch'.

\begin{quote}
An EA sketch E=(G,D,L,C) is a sketch with only finite cones and finite discrete cocones and with a 
specified cone with empty base whose vertex is called 1. Edges with domain 1 are called elements. 
Nodes which are vertices of cocones all of whose injections are elements are called attributes. 
Nodes which are neither attributes, nor 1, are called entitites.
\end{quote}
The theory associated with a sketch is a category of models in a certain 2-category(!).
\begin{quote}
we drop the distinction between entities and relationships. This point of view is also
espoused by other writers on database theory, for example C. J. Date, [7]. It explains
why we have chosen to speak of `EA' sketches rather than `ERA' sketches.
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
As a special case we mention the `keyed' EA sketches in which every entity has
a specified monomorphism to a key attribute.
\end{quote}
Discrete cocones just means coproducts!

What is the rub with entity types which have elements?

Now the claim is that models have to be in categories which are lextensive -- which is to say
that coproducts and limits behave nicely. sums are universal and disjoint (see [\cite {carboni1993}])

universal means

disjoint means 
Why is this?

\section{IDL}
See Lamb 1987 [\cite{Lamb1987}]
On why you should use IDL:
\begin{quote}
1. IDL can describe complex data structures in a simple but formal way.
It gives you a way to talk about the information content of your data
separately from its representation, much more clearly than most programming 
languages do.
2. IDL tools can automatically generate stereotypical modules of a program,
such as input/output procedures.
3. The automatically-generated modules support passing data between programs 
that might be written in different programming languages, and
might run on different machines.
