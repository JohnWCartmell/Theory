\begin{frame}{Concept-Instance Algebra -  Overview}
In a concept-instance algebra there are concepts and instances and there are operations $^*$, $\crossx{}{}{}$ and $\delta$
and these must satisfy various axioms.
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a rooted $\omega$-tree of concepts,
\item for each non-root concept there is a associated set of instances (instances of that concept),
\item operation $^*$ enables  concepts and instances to be particularised (syntactically this is substitution),
\item  operation $\crossx{}{}{}$ enables the positing in-scope concepts and instances (syntactially this is sometimes called weaking),
\item operation $\delta$ is an expression of self (as for example the identity morphisms in a category).
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Summary of Operations -- $^*$, $\cross$ and $\delta$}

In the following summary assume $x_c \base x$ and $y_c \base y$ in the tree of concepts of an algebra $A$. \\

\begin{frame}{Concepts and their Contexts}
\begin{itemize}
\item In a concept-instance algebra $A$ concepts are equally contexts.
\item If $a \base b \base c$ in the tree of concepts of algebra $A$ 
then $a$ is to be understood as the context for concept $b$ and $b$ is to be understood as the context for concept $c$,
\item For example some concepts in cricket

\begin{frame}{Concepts, Contexts  and Instances}
\begin{itemize}
\item Instances of concepts are to be understood as instances in context: If $x_c \base x$  in algebra $A$ and if $i \in inst_A(x)$ thn $i$ is to be considered an instance of $x$ in context $x_c$.
\onslide<2-> {\item Thus $homeSide \in inst(side)$ and $match \base side$ implies  $match$ is context for $homeSide$}
\onslide<4-> {\item and $captain \in inst(player)$ and $side \base player$ implies $side$ is context for $captain$}.
