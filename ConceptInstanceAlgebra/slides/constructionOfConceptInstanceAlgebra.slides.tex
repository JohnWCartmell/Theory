\begin{frame}{Construction of CI-algebra}
Tree of concepts of $CI(C)$ is tree of objects of $C$.

Instances of object $B$ of $C$ are sections of $B$. 

Operations $^*$, $\cross$ are defined in $CI(C)$ using the pullbacks and dependency morphisms of $C$.  
 They are restrictions of  operations $^*$ and $\cross$ defined in my paper
 "" on ResearchGate.
