\begin{frame}{Reminder}
In a contextual category,
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a well-founded partial ordering $<$ between objects
such that there is  a rooted $\omega$-tree of objects,
\item if $y$ covers $x$ in the partial order then write $x \base y$,
\item whenever $x \base y$ in the partial order then there is a distinguished
morphism $p_y:y \morph x$ which I write as $y \smorph x$,
\item the root object is a terminal object in the category,
\item the root object represents the empty context, 
\item non-root objects are at the same time both contexts and types
because the syntactic \underline{difference beween contexts and types} is 
just that - \underline{a syntactic difference}. 
\end{itemize}
