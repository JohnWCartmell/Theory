H G Wells:
\begin{tightquote}
Finally : the Logician, intent upon perfecting the certitudes of his methods rather than upon expressing the confusing subtleties of truth, has done little to help thinking men in the perpetual difficulty that arises from the fact that the universe can be seen in many different fashions and expressed by many different systems of terms, each expression within its limits true and yet incommensurable with expression upon a differing system. There is a sort of stratification in human ideas. I have it very much in mind that various terms in our reasoning lie, as it were, in different planes, and that we accomplish a large amount of error and confusion by reasoning terms together that do not lie or nearly lie in the same plane.
\end{tightquote}
\mynote
A factor in Gilbert Ryle's analysis of the problem is this:
\begin{tightquote}
[a] given word will, in different sorts of context, express ideas of an indefinite range of differing logical types and, therefore, with different logical powers. And what is true of single words is also true of complex expressions and of grammatical constructions. (1945, 206)
\end{tightquote}
Interestingly Ryle describes such ambiguity as systematic : “[u]nnoticed systematic ambiguities are a common source of type-confusions and philosophic problems” which falls short of saying that langauge is inherently ambigous but this is suggested to me by Ryle as quoted on
by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:
\begin{tightquote}
Unlike ambiguous words such as “bank”, “report” or “stud”, the inflections of meaning to which most of our expressions are susceptible nonetheless have affinities: the ideas expressed by these expressions in their various uses are “intimately connected” with each other; they are “different inflections of the same root” (1945, 206).
\end{tightquote}
Ryles suggestion that such ambiguity applies to \textit{most} words and his use of words \textit{inflection} and \textit{root} suggest to me some kind of conceptual grammar. What might this be and is it inherent to the mechanism  of ordinary langauge? 
\mynote 
I can't be sure of the ambiguities that Ryle or Wells have in mind. But ambiguities abound and my examples here focus on the words \textit{book},
\textit{word} and \textit{letter} and, please note, each of these three words being taken in a single dictionary sense.

\mynote 
Three words but how many concepts? Fairly quickly I can delineate nine different concepts, all incontrovertibly 
different types of things with different cardinalities and having instances which are mutually exclusive :
\begin{itemize}
\item [book(1)] This is what we mean when we ask of a publisher `how many books have you published this year?' 
or when an author tells us that they have written a new book.
\item [book(2)] A particular copy of a book. This is the type of thing that we have in mind
 when we ask of a bookshop `how many books have you sold this year?'.
\item [word(1)] This is a word of a particular language. This is what we have in mind if we ask for an estimate for the number of words 
in the English language. 
\item [word(2)] This is what I have in mind if I ask for word frequencies in the works of Shakepeare.   
\item [word(3)] These are words as appear in the printed copies of books. This is what I have in mind if I say 'that word is illegible'.
\item [letter(1)] These are the letters which are enumerated by alphabets. These are what I have in mind when I say that the English language has
twenty six letters.
\item [letter(2)] This is a letter as used in a spelling of a word. It is this type of thing that you count 
as the the number of letters in a word when you are doing a crossword puzzle. 
\item [letter(3)] This is a letter as used to spell a particular word in a particular book by an author. 
\item [letter(4)] This is a printed copy of a letter in a book. 
\end{itemize}

\mynote
These nine  concepts are in close relationship to one another, \textit{intimately related}, to use the words of Ryle.
Some of these \textit{intimate relationships} are shown in this diagram:

\section{The Meta-Theory of Generalised Algebraic Theories}
In such and uch a place I describe a generalised algebraic theory of generalised algebraic theories  
which I call \highlight{$MetaGAT$} in view of the fact that it can said to be a meta theory of generalised algebraic theories.
Here I re-articulate in an attempt not to lean as heavily on an appeal to syntactic notions. 

\section{Background}
As described in \cite{Cartmell86}, Contextual Categories provide algebraic representations of Generalised Algebraic Theories  in the sense that to every Generalised Algebraic Theory $U$ there is a contextual category $\mathbb{C}(U)$ such that algebras of the theory $U$ are exactly structure preserving functors (contextual functors)  from $\mathbb{C}(U)$ into the contextual category $Fam$ of sets, families of sets and so on. We summarise this by saying that Contextual Categories provide the algebraic semantics of Generalised Algebraic Theories. 

\noindent
Contextual categories contain structure that is in some sense redundant; this is in the same way that a Lawvere algebraic theory contains redundant structure compared to the otherwise equivalent notion, from universal algebra, of an abstract clone (see, for example, \cite{KerkoffonClones}). In both cases the redundancy is introduced in order to achieve a definition in which the algebras are categories with some sort of additional structure. Remove the redundancy and there is no longer a category directly visible in the definitions.

Terminology: By \highlight{a section of an object $B$}
 in a contextual category \catc, I mean a morphism $f:A\rightarrow B$ in \catc, where 
$A \base B$ and satisfying  $f \comp p_B = id_A$\footnote{In my thesis the notation $Arr_{\catc}(B)$ was used for what here we refer to as the sections and denote $Sect_{\catc}(B)$.}.


A \term{concept-instance} algebra consists of an $\omega$-tree of concepts and, 
for each concept $x$, a set $i(x)$
said to be the set of instances of $x$.
It comes equipped with three operations $^*$, $\crossx{}{}{}$ and $\delta$ and   
satisfies certain axioms.

\noindent
One way of explaining what constitutes a concept-instance algebra 
is to say that it consists of the $\omega$-tree of objects of a contextual category along with, 
for each object its set of sections  and with operations and axioms that completely encapsulate the structure of the contextual category. Vladimir Voevodsy and referred to such structures as \term{B-systems}.

The concepts of a concept-instance algebra corresponds to the objects of a contextual category. 
Accordingly  each concept corresponds to  a rule of a genealised algebraic theory $U$ of the form
\gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\isT{\Delta}}. \\
Each instance corresponds to a rule of the form:
 \gatdisplayrule{\xDelta{n}}{\ofT{t}{\Delta}}.

\vspace{1cm}
The  operations $^*$ and $\crossx{}{}{}$  
 correspond in the syntax to  substitution and  weakening but here I refer to them as \term{particulising} and 
 \term{positing}.

In brief, these operations are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In a concept-instance algebra $A$, if $y$ is a concept and if $f$ is an instance of $y$
 and if $z$ is a concept so that $y < z$ then $f^*z$ is defined and is a concept of $A$ 
      such that \commentary{we could speak of concept $z$ being particularised to instance $f$.}
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
			\item if $y \base z$ then $x \base f^*z$,
			\item if $z \base z'$ and $y <z$ then $f^*z \base f^*z'$,
			\end{enumerate} 

\input{../content/starintro.concepts.caseone}
\item if in addition $g$ is a instance of $z$ then $f^*g$ is defined and is a concept at $f^*z$. \\
\input{../content/starintro.instances.caseone}


At this point it follows that if $y \base z_1 ... \base z_m \base z$ and $g$ is a instance of $z$ then we have:

\commentary{intrductory rules for $^*$}
\input{../content/starintrospeltout} 

\item If $w,x$ and $y$ are concepts of $A$  and if $w \base x$ and $w < y$ then $x \cross_w y$ is a concept of $A$ 
such that
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item if $w \base y$ then $x \base x \cross_w y$,
		\item if $y \base y'$ and $y <z$ then $x \cross_w y \base x \cross_w y'$,
		\end{enumerate}
\item if in addition $g$ is a instance of $y$ then $x \cross_w g$ is an instance of $x \cross_w y$.

At this point it follows that if $w \base y_1 ... \base y_m \base y$ and $g$ is a instance of $y$ then we have
\commentary{introductory rules for $\cross$}
\input{../content/crossinstanceintroshortened}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\item If $x$ and $y$ are concepts of $A$ such that $x \base y$ then $\delta_y$ is a instance of $\crossx{y}{y}{x}$
\vspace{0.5cm}
\commentary{introductory rule for $\delta$}
\input{../content/deltaintroshortened} 
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Note to myself: In the above I ought to remove subscript from crossx.}

Such a structure as this is a concept-instance algebra providing the following axioms hold  
\begin{align}
(f^*g)^*(f^*z) &= f^*(g^*z)        &\mbox{\scriptsize(8)}& \mbox{whenever $f \in inst(x),\ g \in inst(y),\ x < y$ and  $y < z$} \\
(f^*g)^*(f^*h) &= f^*(g^*h)        &\mbox{\scriptsize(9)}& \mbox{where as above  and also $h \in inst(z)$ }\\
(x \cross y) \cross (x \cross z) &= x \cross (y \cross z)
                                   &\mbox{\scriptsize(14)}& \mbox{whenever $x_c < y$, where $x_c \base x$, and $x_c < z$} \\
(x \cross y) \cross (x \cross g) &= x \cross (y \cross g)
                                   &\mbox{\scriptsize(15)}& \mbox{where as above  and also $g \in inst(z)$}\\
f^*(x \cross y) &= y               &\mbox{\scriptsize(16)}& \mbox{whenever $f \in inst(x)$ and $x_c < y$, where $x_c \base x$}\\
f^*(x \cross g) &= g               &\mbox{\scriptsize(17)}& \mbox{where as above  and also $g \in inst(y)$}\\
f^*y \cross f^*z &= f^*(y \cross z)  %problem here  
                    &\mbox{\scriptsize(18)}& \mbox{whenever $f \in inst(x)$, $x < z$, $x < y$ and $y_c <z$ where $y_c \base y$}\\
f^*y \cross f^*g &= f^*(y \cross g)    &\mbox{\scriptsize(19)}& \mbox{where as above  and also $g \in inst(z)$}\\
(x \cross g)^*(x \cross z)&=x \cross(g^*z) &\mbox{\scriptsize(20)}& \mbox{whenever $g \in inst(y)$ and $x_c < y$ and $y < z$, where $x_c \base x$}\\
(x \cross g)^*(x \cross h)&=x \cross(g^*h) &\mbox{\scriptsize(21)}& \mbox{where as above  and also $h \in inst(z)$}\\
\delta_x ^*(x \cross y)&=y                 &\mbox{\scriptsize(24)}& \mbox{whenever  $x < y$}\\
\delta_x ^*(x \cross g)&=g                 &\mbox{\scriptsize(25)}& \mbox{whenever  $x < y$ and $g\in inst(y)$}\\
f \sub \diag(x) &= f                       &\mbox{\scriptsize(26)}& \mbox{whenever  $f \in inst(x)$}\\
f \sub \diag(y) &= \diag(f \sub y)         &\mbox{\scriptsize(27)}& \mbox{whenever  $f \in inst(x)$ and  $x < y$.}
\end{align}

We can visualise the first of these axioms like this: 
\input{../content/stardistributivityaxiom}


\noindent
\highlightpara{
Compared to the theory of contextual categories, the theory $MetaGAT$ does not introduce redundant structure; it axiomatises the types and the terms of the theory directly and these correspond to the objects and the sections of a corresponding contextual category. The theory of contextual categories, on the other hand, axiomatises n-tuples of terms for any n; it is  these that are represented by the morphisms of a contextual category.}  

\noindent
\highlightpara{
The theory MetaGAT is closely related to the notion of B-system described by Voevodsky in
\cite{Voevodsky14B}.
and to the algebras over a monad described by Richard Garner in \cite{Garner15}.  
}
\section{Summarising}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The category of $MetaGAT$ algebras and the category of contextual categories are isomorphic. 
\item There is an isomorphism between the theory of contextual categories and the theory $MetaGAT$ in the category of existentially and identity enriched generalised algebraic theories. 
\item There is no such isomorphism in the category of generalised algebraic theories.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent $MetaGAT$ algebras may have interpretations (and, therefore, applications) where Contextual Categories do not.

\section{Concept delineation}

\section{Re-Articulation ---  Concept-Instance algebra}

\mynote
There are \term{concepts} and each concept has a set of \term{instances}. There is a concept of \term{the absolute}($Abs$)
 This concept has exactly one instance ($abs$). 

\mynote
Every concept except the absolute has a \term{context} which it \term{depends on} and which itself is a concept. 
We write $ctxt(B)$
for the  concept that concept $B$ depends on.

We write $A \base B$  when  $A$ and $B$ are contexts and $B$ depends on $A$.

\mynote
If there exists $B_1,...B_n$ such that
$A \base B_1 \base B2 ... \base B_n \base B$ then we say that $B$ \term{indirectly depends on} $A$.

\mynote Every concept is directly or indirectly dependent on the absolute.

\mynote
Two operations act on concepts and instances: \term{particularisation} denoted
$^*$ and \term{consideration}  denoted $\cross$.

\mynote
$f^*x$ is the particularisation of $x$ to $f$
\mynote
$\crossx{x}{y}{w}$ is concept or instance $y$ considered in the context $x$ constrained within the bounding context $w$
\mynote
If $y$ depends directly or indirectly on $x$ then we say that $y$ is \term{within} $x$.
We also say that an instance $g$ of a concept $y$ is within $x$ provided that concept $y$ is within $x$.

\mynote 
Therefore every concept and instance is either the absolute or is within the absolute.
Therefore the absolute  is also \term{the whole}\footnote{See also \url{www.entitymodelling.org/tutorialone/absolute.html}}. It is the concept of the whole of everything.

Both concepts and instances can be particularised.
$^*$ is a binary infix operation. Its first argument is an instance its second is either concept or instance.

\item if $g$ is an instance of $B$ then $f^*g$ is an instance of $f^*B$.
\end{itemize}

\mynote 
The consideration operator $\cross$ is a ternary operation:
$\crossx{A}{y}{X}$ is concept or instance $y$ considered in the context $A$ constrained within some bounding context $X$.

$\crossx{A}{y}{X}$ is defined iff $X$ is a concept, $A$ is a concept  within $X$ and $y$ is either
a concept or an instance within $X$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item if $ctxt(B)=X$ then $ctxt(\crossx{A}{B}{X})=A$,
\item if $ctxt(B)$ indirectly depends on $A$ then $ctxt(\crossx{A}{B}{X})=\cross{A}{cntxt(B)}{X}$,
\item if $g$ is an instance of $B$ then $\crossx{A}{g}{X}$ is an instance of $\crossx{A}{B}{X}$.
\end{itemize}

For every concept $A$ there is an instance $self_A$. $self_A$ is an instance of $\crossx{A}{A}{X}$ where $X$ is the context of $A$.

Analyse these two concepts: 
\begin{equation}
\label{twofromplays}
\mbox{\textit{`two characters from the plays of shakespeare'}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{twofromsingleplay}
\mbox{\textit{`two characters from a play by shakespeare'}}
\end{equation}

Assume this concept model:

 \vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{displaymath}
\pstree[treemode=R,levelsep=*0.65cm,treesep=1cm,nodesep=0.05]
 {
    \Tr{\circ}

			  }			
			}
		\iffalse	
	 \Tr{f \sub y} \member {f \sub g}
	\fi
 }
\end{displaymath}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Concept (\ref{twofromplays}) is represented by $s^*(\crossx{c}{c}{w})$ because
\begin{itemize}
\item The concept of two characters in plays by the same playwright is $\crossx{c}{c}{w}$.
\item Particularised to plays by shakespeare this is $s^*(\crossx{c}{c}{w})$.
\end{itemize}

Diagramming the tree we have

 }
\end{displaymath}

Equally concept (\ref{twofromplays}) maybe represented by $\crossx{s^*c}{s^*c}{Abs}$.
This is an example of the distributive law at work in concept-instance algabra.


Concept (\ref{twofromsingleplay}) is represented by $s^*(\crossx{c}{c}{p})$ because
\begin{itemize}
\item The concept of two characters in the same play is $\crossx{c}{c}{p}$.
\item Particularised to plays by shakespeare this is $s^*(\crossx{c}{c}{p})$.

Equally, concept (\ref{twofromsingleplay}) may be represented by $\crossx{s^*c}{s^*c}{s^*p}$. This is the distributive law at work again.

A citizen in the context of a triangle is written as:
$$
triangle \cross citizen
$$
and since a citizen needs a country for context:
$$
country \base citizen
$$
 therefore $triangle \cross citizen$ requires $triangle \cross country$:
$$ triangle \cross country \base triangle \cross citizen$$.


One citizen in the context of another, when written as:
$$citizen \cross citizen$$
is ambiguous and is therefore written instead as:
$$citizen \cross_{country} citizen$$
if we imagine a citizen of the same country or is written as as
$$citizen \cross_1 citizen$$
if we imagine absolutely any other citizen of any country whatsoever, 
where $1$ represents \textit{the absolute}. 

Particularisation of  citizen to instance france of country is written as
$france^*citizen$.
