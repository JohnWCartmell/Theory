I shall describe an algebra of concepts and instances
which are either absolute or contextual 
(contextual meaning that they are what they are only in context),
in which contexts are nested
and in which concepts are equally contexts. 
I call the algebras CI-algebras and I will describe a generalised algebrac theory 
of CI-algebras. CI-algebras are a re-articulation of structures that Vladimir Voevodsky described 
as B-systems and which have been described independently as algebras over a monad by Richard Garner.
I will discuss the formal relationships between CI-algebras, generalised algebraic theories
 and contextual categories and, informally, by example, to entity-relationship modelling and data specification.
