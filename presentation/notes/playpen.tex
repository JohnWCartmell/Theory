\section{introduction}
start with introductory generalities including table of features within structured data

\section{chemistry data}
go to chemistry data

discuss nested relational data model discuss XML tags discuss IDL languages
discusssion of Jackson notation
data structure diagram notation - hierarchical
data structure notation         - network (add one relationship - different color)
describe foreign key - foreign key constraint - referential integrity constraint

reverse arrows to give category -- many-one relationship
add morphisms to string, number, symbol

then show box notation 

then show ER script diagram

discuss relational 1NF, 2NF and 3NF and
show data when "normalised"
 discuss how many more foreign keys now

relation - tuple row - relational schema subset of cartesian product

COULD mention keys and foreign keys at this point. Because rows of the second tabular are referenced by columns of the first tabular.

This is called an \term{inclusion depedency}
  and is expressed by 

$compound[formula.symbol] \subseteq element[symbol]$

Since on the rhs symbol is a key to element then this inclusion dependency is \textit{referential}.

In practice called foreign key or a referential integirty constraint.

Codd 1970 exhorts 1st Normal Form so without repeated values for example like so:
Two tabulars.

Explain Codd's exhortation to store this data relationally which is by way of flat tabulars of data like this:


do I speak about ubiquity of relational model at this point.

the Chen Unified Model of Data entity relational attribute

Chen's terminology has been adapted so that when i speak of relationships (unqualified) I will mean many-one relationships between entities.

These diagrams I have drawn in my ER script software.

\section{formal stuff}
\subsection{Naked Categories}
\subsection{Categories with specified monomorphisma and epimorphisms}
\subsection{Categories with finite products and specified monomorphisms and epimorphisms}
\subsection{Categores with all finite limits}
\subsection{Categories with pullbacks of distinguished morphisms}
\subsection{ER Script}
Only certain kinds of commuting diagram are supported
These are called scope diagrams
Each diagram gives the scope of a relationship
Equivalent to giving signature of an operation in a GAT
With the restriction that identifying relationships are structural these are sufficient to achieve generation of relational model from an ER model and for it to be in normal form.
