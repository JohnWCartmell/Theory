A data specification  
\begin{itemize}
\item is a  theory (of what is)
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\textcolor{myblue}{\scalebox{2}{$\therefore$}} a data specification method 
\begin{itemize}
\item is a method for expressing such a  theory
\item unequivocally it enables definitions of types and certain relationships between these types
\item types are equally types of data and types of real world entity
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data Specifications}
More precisely, 
\begin{itemize}
\item data specification are presentations of theories of what is
\item choice of primitives in a given presentation is choice of which data to be stored or communicated
\item independence of primitives is absence of redundancy in data 
\item engineering driven goodness criteria (3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)  can be interpreted as driving 
logical completeness of the theory with respect to intended instances
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data Specification as Category}
\begin{itemize}
\item
What types of things are there and how are they related? 
\pause \begin{itemize}
\item Data specifications provide the answer to this question in the context of a software development. 
\item Types theories provide the answer in the context of mathematics. 
\item Category theory abstracts across both these domains.
\end{itemize}
\item Not surprising that a data spcification can be seen as a category or as a sketch of a category
\pause \item ... or as a contextual category
\pause ... since our instinct for types and types that vary comes from the real world not from mathematics.
\end{itemize}

Two kinds of types in play
\begin{itemize}
\item  the \textit{definienda} -- types all of whose instances are \term{particulars}
\begin{itemize}
\item employee, department, student, account, product, order, shipment, delivery, flight, booking and so on
\item molecular structure, atom, bond, element, isotope, reaction, metabolite, mass trace, chromatogram, peak
\item table, column, primary key, foreign key
\item node and edge. 
\end{itemize}
\pause 
\item  the \textit{definiens}  -- types all of whose instances are \term{universals}
\begin{itemize}
       \item string, integer, float, boolean and so on
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item in ER modelling 
\begin{itemize}
\item the \textit{definienda} are called \textit{entity types}
\item the \textit{definiens} are called \textit{attribute types} or \textit{domains}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Data Specifications}
A data specification is a sketch of a category with some additional structure:
\begin{itemize}
\item that it is a \term{sketch} is crucial because it is only nodes and edges of the sketch for which data is stored and/or communicated, 
\item that there are commutative diagrams is crucial to construction of physical 
specifications from logical specifications.
\item that the category had additional structure is significant:
\begin{itemize}
\item so that we can give account of database normal forms 
(BCNF, 3NF, 4NF and 5NF),
\item so that we can allow for missing data as represented by NULL values, 
\item so that we can distinguish structural from non-structural relationships to describe structure nesting and thereby hierarchical data,
\item so that types of universals can be distinguished from types of particulars.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Database Normal Forms}
\begin{itemize}
\item presentations (sketches) should be minimal and avoid redundancy:

     \item Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)
     \item fourth normal form (4NF)
     \item fifth normal form (5NF)

\begin{frame}{Relational Database Theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item classic relational database normal form definitions ({\scriptsize 3NF, EKNF, BCNF, 4NF,5NF, INC-NF}) can be transfered into the more general framework
of ER modelling and formalised within the definitional framework of EA sketches

\item such normal forms  examine the fit of a sketch/theory (database schema) to an intended usage

\item we can assume that the intended usage is represented by a full-subcategory of the category $Mod(S,\cat{FinSet})$

\item in such a situation the classic normal forms address the question can the sketch/theory $S$ be improved by addition or removal of morphisms and/or commutative diagrams and/or limit cones.
\item normalisation has dual goal of obtaining as complete a theory as possible and of eliminating redundancy from the sketch.

If $T$ is a theory and $W \subset |Mod(T,FinSet)|$ is an intended usage then an interpretation (theory morphism) $I: T \morph T'$ is an improvement of $T$ wrt $W$ iff

and $W \subseteq img(Mod(I,Finset))$.

\item If a relational schema $R$ can be normalised to $R'$ then the associated theory $T$ of $R$ can be improved to the associated thery $T'$ of $R'$.

\begin{itemize}
\item concept of \textit{candidate keys} used in relational database normal form definitions {\scriptsize (3NF, EKNF, BCNF)}
\item in ER model talk about \textit{identifying} families of relationships
\item in category theory such a key or a family of relationships is a mono source i.e. a to jointly monic family of morphisms
\item mono sources and hence candidate keys can be defined as limit cones
\item more than 99.99 percent of entity modelling uses just mono sources and no other limits
