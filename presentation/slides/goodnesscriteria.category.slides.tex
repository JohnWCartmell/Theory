\begin{frame}{Data Specification}
A \textit{data specification} is a sketch $S$ for some kind of structured category \catc.
i.e. it is a directed graph plus some path equivalences (diagrams in other words) plus 
some additional structure.  

An \textit{instance} of a data specification is a mapping $D$ from the directed graph
to the category of sets and functions which preserves structure so as
to induce a structure preserving functor $D: \catc \morph \Fin$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Requirement}
A \textit{requirement} for a data specification $S$ 
is a set of instances of the sketch $S$ or, equivalently, is a set $R_C$ of functors where for each
$D \in R_C$, $D: \catc \morph \Fin$, where \catcw is the category generated by the sketch $S$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Goodness Criteria for a Data Specification}
\IfSforCwithRCwordsvariant 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\textbf {Goodness Criteria of Type 1 :} No redundancy. The sketch $S$ ought to be a minimum sketch for structured category \catcw i.e. there should be no subsketch of $S$ which generates  \catc.
\item
\textbf {Goodness Criteria of Type 2:} \catcw ought to be \textit{maximally constrained} to $\reqtc$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Rationale for Type 1 Criteria}
Must follow the type 1 criteria 
\begin{itemize}
\item to ensure there is no redundancy in the  data that is stored and/or communicated,
\item avoid unnecessary data constraints (such as those that impose uniqueness or referential integrity).
\end{itemize} 
\medskip
One thing to have a system that is out of step with the real world quite another to have a system 
in a state that doesn't correspond to any possible  real world state.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Rationale for Type 2 Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Good data modelling is good theorising and good theorising is having the tightest theory that fits the facts.
\item Software Engineering: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Document the requirement.
\item Validate data against the requirement. 
\item Restrict degrees of freedom in the data representation.
\item Use declarative style if possible.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Try all we can to avoid the possibility of a system state 
that doesn't correspond to any real world state.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key definition: \catcw \textit{maximally constrained} to $\reqtc$}
\begin{itemize}
\item The structured category \catcw ought to be the tightest possible fit to the requirement $R_{\catc}$.

\item The question -- is there a $\catcp$ that extends \catcw and that will do a better job. 

\item Is there a $\catcp$ and an $I: \catc \morph \catcp$  such that 
all instances in the requirement $\reqtc$ factor though $I$
$$
\begin{array} {c p{2cm} c}
\Rnode{Cp}{C'} && \\ [0.25cm]

$$
and
\pause  at least one other instance $F$ of \catcw does not factor through $I$.
\ncarr[-20]{C}{finset}
\blabel{F} 
\end{itemize}
\pause If there is no such $I: \catc \morph \catcp$ then we shall say that 
\catcw is \term{maximally constrained} with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Representational Completeness}
Alternative way of approaching tightest fit:
\begin{itemize}
\item That which is in the data and can be represented in the theory should be represented in the theory.
\item To make precise we can give definitions
 of \textit{representational completeness} wrt $\reqtc$ 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}l l} 
2A. & equationally complete   \\
2B. & functionally complete   \\
2C. & referentially complete  \\
2D. & mono complete           \\
2E. & epi complete            \\
2F. & product complete        \\
2G. & pullback complete       \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\pause \item In these defintions that \catcw is $x$ complete wrt $\reqtc$ will mean exactly that the set of instances $\reqtc$ are jointly reflective of $x$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Next steps}
For each of
\begin{itemize}
\item categories,
\item categories with designated monomorphisms and epimorphisms,
\item categories with designated monomorphisms and epimorphisms and with finite products
\end{itemize}
\medskip
I am going to
\begin{itemize}
\item define appropriate notions of representational completeness,
\item explore relationship between representational completeness and maximal constrainedness.
\end{itemize}

Herein lies much of the mathematical theory of data but as many or more questions than answers.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definitions} 
In a category \catc, a  \term{source} is a family of morphisms with common domain: \\
\scalebox{0.65}{
\multisourcediagram{n}{a}{b}{f}
} 
\medskip
Such a source is said to be a \term{mono source}  iff for all $g,h:x \morph a$ in \catcw 
so that \scalebox{0.65}{
\monosourcedefinitiondiagram{x}{g}{h}{n}{a}{b}{f}

in \catcw then if $g \circ f_i = h \circ f_i$, for each $i$,  then $g=h$.

\begin{frame}{Alternative Definition}{Mono Source Limit Cone}  
In a category \cat{C},

} is a mono source iff \\
\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.65}{

is a limit cone.
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{BCNF in the abstract}
If $S$ is a simple sketch for a category $C$ with designated mono-sources  and finite products
and $S$ is considered as a data specification with requirement $\reqtc$, then it ought to be the case
that if  
\multisourcenplusonediagram{n}{a}{b}{x}{c}{y}
are edges of $S$
and if \msfd{x_1,...x_n}{y}  is a non-trivial functional dependency  between these edges then
$x_1,...x_n$ is a designated mono-source.

\begin{frame}{Sketches of Categories as Data Specifications}

\begin{frame}{Equational Completeness}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a  category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances,
 then say that  $\catc$ is \term{equationally complete} with respect 
to the requirement $\reqtc$ iff all path equivalences with respect to $R_C$ are represented in \catcw 
i.e. iff for all diagrams \fgparalleldiagram in $\catc$,  
if in all instances $D \in \reqtc$, $D(f)=D(g)$,  then $f=g$.
\end{definition}

In other words:
the set of functors $\reqtc$ is jointly faithful.
\medskip
\goodnesscriteria{2A} \IfSforCwithRCwords then \catcw ought to be equationally complete
with respect to $R_C$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Equational completeness cont. }
Does equational completeness follow from maximal constrainedness?
It does if we assume local finiteness of \catc:
\begin{lemma}[Path Equivalence Representation Lemma]
If $\catc$ is a locally finite category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, if $\catc$ 
 is
\textit{maximally constrained} to the requirement $\reqtc$ then it is equationally
complete with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose \fgparalleldiagram  in $\catc$ and that in all instances $D \in \reqtc$, $D(f)=D(g)$. 
Define $\catcp$ to be \catc plus $f=g$. Consider the Hom functor $Hom_{\catc}(a,\_)$. 
This is an instance of $\catc$ which therefore extends to an instance $H$ of $\catcp$.  Then
$Hom_{\catc}(a,f)=H(I(f))=H(I(g))=Hom(a,g)$ and applying to $id_a$ we have that $f=g$.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Does Criteria 2A follow from Criteria 2 -- Not always}
Suppose \catcw is the category generated by the sketch with directed graph

subject to the identities
\begin{equation}
\label{fhidentity}
f \circ h = id_a,

\label{ghidentity}
g \circ h = id_a,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{rhhpidentity}
r \circ h \circ h' = id_b.
\end{equation}
We can show that for any functor $D:\catc \morph Fin$, $D(f)=D(g)$. 

If $R_C$ is the set of all functors from \catcw into $\Fin$ then with respect to $\reqtc$, Criteria 2 holds but Criteria 2A does not.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Functional Dependencies}
To describe Goodness Criteria 2B I first need to
\begin{itemize}
\item Define what we mean by \term{functional dependency}
-- abstracted and simplified from definition given by Codd 1971.
\item Define what we mean by a functional dependency being \term{represented}
-- inspired by language I found in Zaniola 1982.
\item State as the criteria that all functional dependencies ought to be represented -- which I think is in
the spirit of Zaniola's paper. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of Functional Dependency}
\begin{definition}
If \scalebox{0.9}{\fgsourcediagram} in a category \catcw  and if $\reqtc$ is a set of instances of \catcw
then we say that there is a  \term{functional dependency} of $g$ on $f$ with respect to $\reqtc$ iff
for every $D \in \reqtc$, $D(g)$ factors uniquely through $D(f)$. \\
\pause \medskip
i.e.  in every $D$, $D(f)$ is surjective and there is a family of  functions $H_D:D(b) \morph D(c))_{D \in \reqtc}$
such that in each instance $D \in \reqtc$,
\scalebox{0.9}{\fghfactordiagram{\roomup{0.4cm}\roomdown{0.3cm}D(a)}{D(b)}{D(c)}{D(f)}{D(g)}{H_D}} commutes.
\end{definition}

\pause If $H$ is such a functional dependency then we say that $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ in $\catc$ with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Notation Alert}
The notation 
$$
f \morph g
$$
for functional dependency is adapted from relational database theory. 

\begin{itemize}
\item This is not to imply a morphism or 2-cell or any such thing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{definition}{Representation of Functional Dependency}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, 
if \fgsourcediagram in $\catc$ 
and if there is a functional dependency $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ then say that 
this functional dependency  is \term{represented} in $\catc$ 
iff there exists a morphism $h:b \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that for each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(h)=H_D$.
\end{definition}
\medskip
If \catcw is a requirement and $\reqtc$ a set of instances then \catcw is said to be 
\textit{functionally complete} with respect to $\reqtc$ iff every functional dependency
present in $\reqtc$ is represented in \catc.\\
\medskip
\goodnesscriteria{2B}\IfSforCwithRCwords then \catcw ought to be functionally complete with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Representation Lemma for Functional Dependencies}
I can prove this only in the case that \catcw is locally finite.

\begin{lemma}
If $\catc$ is a locally finite category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, if $\catc$ is 
\textit{maximally constrained} to the requirement $\reqtc$ then 
\catcw is functionally complete with respect to $\reqtc$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose$\fundep{H}{f}{g}$  is a functional dependency with respect to $\reqtc$
such that in all instances $D \in \reqtc$, $D(f)$ is surjective.

Extend \catcw to $\catcp$ by formally adding a morphism $h$. Extend each $D$ to a $D'$ by defining $D(h)=H_D$. 
Because $D(f)$ is surjective $D'$ is unique. 
Define a functor from \catcw to $\Fin$ as  a certain quotient of the coproduct of functor $Hom_{\catc}(a,-)$ with itself. 
Extend to $\catcp$ and demonstrate that there exists $k:b \morph c$ in \catcw such that $f \circ k=g$. 
which shows that $\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ is represented in $\catc$.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof 1.}
We have \fgsourcediagram in \catc.\\
\medskip
Define functor $F: \catc \morph \Fin$ be the coproduct $Hom_{\catc}(a,-) + Hom_{\catc}(a,-)$.
Label the injections $L$ and $R$, respectively so that
for each object $x$ of $\catc$ the diagram
\begin{center}
$
\begin{array}{c p{0.5cm} c p{0.5cm} c  }
\Rnode{h1}{Hom_{\catc}(a,x)}  &&\Rnode{Fx}{F(x)}  &&   \Rnode{h2}{Hom_{\catc}(a,x)}       
\end{array} 
$
\ncarr{h1}{Fx}
\alabel{L_x}
\ncarr{h2}{Fx}
\blabel{R_x}
\end{center}
is a coproduct in $\Fin$.
\medskip
Define $G: \catc \morph \Fin$ as quotient $F/\sim$ where
\begin{align*}
L_x(k_1) \sim_x R_x(k_2) & \mbox{ iff there exists $k:b \morph x$ in $\catc$ such that $k_1 = f \circ k = k_2$,}\\
L_x(k_1) \sim_x L_x(k_2) & \mbox{ iff $k_1 = k_2$,} \\
R_x(k_1) \sim_x R_x(k_2) & \mbox{ iff $k_1 = k_2$.} \\
\end{align*} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof 2.}
We have \simpleunaryfdrepresentationdiagram{a}{b}{c}{f}{g}{\qq{h}}  in \catcp.\\
\medskip
Extend $G$ to $G':\catcp \morph \Fin.$ \\

\medskip
\begin{align*}
&\mbox{Now} & [L_b(f)]                         &= [R_b(f)]                 \\
&\mbox{i.e.}& G'(f)([L_a(id_a)])              &= G'(f)([R_a(id_a)])       \\
&\therefore & G'(\qq{h}) (G'(f)([L_a(id_a)])) &= G'(\qq{h}) (G'(f)([R_a(id_a)])) \\
&\therefore & G'(g)([L_a(id_a)])              &= G'(g)([R_a(id_a)]) & &    \\
&\therefore & [L_c(g)]                        &= [R_c(g)] 
\end{align*}
Therefore there exists $k:b \morph c$ in 
$\catc$ such that $f \circ k = g$ and we have shown as required that the function dependency
$\fundep{H}{f}{g}$ is represented in $\catc$.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Inclusion Dependencies}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances 
and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$, then an \term{inclusion dependency} $I$, written $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$, is a family of functions $I_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$
such that each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $I_D$ is a function $I_D : D(a) \morph D(c)$ such that
for each $i$, $1 \leq i \le n$, $I_D \circ D(q_i) = D(f_i)$.
\end{definition}

If each function in this family is the unique such function then the inclusion dependency is said to be referential. Just to be clear the definition is this:
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of Referential Inclusion Dependency}
\begin{definition}
If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances 
and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$, then a \term{referential inclusion dependency} $I$, written $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$, is a family of functions $I_D)_{D \in \reqtc}$
such that each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $I_D$ is a unique function $I_D : D(a) \morph D(c)$ such that
for each $i$, $1 \leq i \le n$, $I_D \circ D(q_i) = D(f_i)$.
\end{definition}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Definition of Referentially Complete}

If $\catc$ is a category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances and if
\fnsourceqnsource
in $\catc$ and if $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$ is a referential inclusion dependency
with respect  to $\reqtc$ then say that the inclusion dependency $I$ is \term{represented} in $\catc$
iff there exists a morphism $i:a \morph c$ in $\catc$ such that in each instance $D \in \reqtc$, $D(i) = I_D$. 
\end{definition}
If \catcw is a category and $\reqtc$ a set of instances then 
\catcw is \term{referentially complete} with respect to $\reqtc$ 
iff all referential inclusion dependencies present in $\reqtc$ are represented in \catc.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Goodness Criteria 2C}
\goodnesscriteria{2C} \IfSforCwithRCwords 
\catcw ought to be referentially complete with respect to $\reqtc$.

I would like to show that this goodness criteria follows from the criteria of maximal constrainedness
but I have managed to prove this only in the case that \catcw is locally finite. \highlight{CHECK}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Representation Lemma for Referential Inclusion Dependencies}
If \catcw is a locally finite category and $\reqtc$ is a set of instances, if \catcw is 
\textit{maximally constrained} to the requirement $\reqtc$ then
every referential inclusion dependency with respect to $\reqtc$ is represented in $\catc$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof}
Suppose $a[f_1,...f_n] \overset{I}{\subseteq} c[q_1,..q_n]$ is a referential inclusion dependency
where for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$,
\scalebox{0.9}{$

Extend category \catcw to a category \catcpw such that in \catcpw there is
a morphism $\qq{r}: a \morph c$ such that for each $i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, 
$\qq{r} \circ q_i = f_i$.
Every $D \in \reqtc$ extends uniquely to functor $D: \catcp \morph \Fin$. Therefore, since \catcw is maximally constrained then every functor $F: \catc \morph \Fin$ can be extended to $F':\catcp \morph \Fin$. \\
\pause Let $H: \catcp \morph \Fin$ be the extension of the hom functor $Hom(a,-): \catc \morph \Fin$ to 
\catcp. \\
\pause For each $i$, we have $H(\qq{r}) \circ H(q_i) = H(f_i)$, \\
\pause \hspace {3cm} i.e. $H(\qq{r}) \circ Hom(a,q_i) = Hom(a,f_i)$. \\
\pause Therefore in particular $H(\qq{r})(id_a) \circ q_i =  f_i$. \\
\pause Hence $H(\qq{r})(id_a):a \morph c$ in \catcw represents the inclusion dependency $I$.

\begin{frame}{Finitary Property}
\begin{definition}
Define a category \catcw to have the \term{finitary property} iff for all objects $x$ and for all endomorphisms 
$f: x \morph x$ the following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is a monomorphism,
\item $f$ is an epimorphism.

\begin{frame}{Deducing Monos and Epis}
Consider, in any category \catcw, whenever \fgcomposablediagram{x}{y}{z}{f}{g} then
\begin{itemize}
\item $f \circ g$ is a monomorphism implies $f$ is a monomorphism.
\item $f \circ g$ is an epimorphism implies $g$ is an epimorphism.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Further to this if \catcw has the \term{finitary property} then whenever \fgcomposablediagram{x}{x}{x}{f}{g} 
such that $f \circ g = id_x$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism,
\item $g$ is a monomorphism and an epimorphism.

\begin{equation}

If we see this as a sketch for a category with the finitary property then we can deduce that $h$ is a monomorphism
and from this that $f=g$.  It is no longer a counter example (to criteria 2 implies criteria 2A).
