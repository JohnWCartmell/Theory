\note
Data specifications are theories of what is
and different methodologies for data specification, i.e. different notions of data specification, correspond to different notions of theory. 

\note
Data specifications have instances.  Notionally let there be a set S of instances that are intended or forseen and characterise the intended use of the data structure. Of all possible instances of a data specification some fall within S and some may not.

\note
When viewed abstractly many apparently different notions of data specification can be characterised as having
data specifications corresponding to sketches of categories or restriction categories with some additional structure such as certain limits and/or colimits.

\note
Instances of such data specifications correspond to structure preserving functors from the corresponding category to the category of finite sets. 

\note
Redundancy of arrows in a sketch corresponds to redundacy of data in instances of the data specification. 

\note
Generally it is a goal of data specification to avoid redundancy of data in instances. 

\note 
Within each particular methodology, a general engineering principle is that a data specification should be as constraining as possible
of data instances while being general enough for the intended useage; equivalently the corresponding theory should be as tight as possible. 

\note
We can define goodness criteria for data specifications if we have a notion of all instances which the data specification is a theory of
i.e. an intended usegae. 

\note
Goodness equates to absence of redundancy and tightness to intended useage.
