\caption{If all deliveries are made from items picked from a single warehouse 
then this model fails clause (iii) of the definition of well-formulated because, with tespect to entity type $p$, the path $\tuple{R,wN}$ will be dependent on the path $\tuple{dI}$ but neither is the set 
$\{\tuple{dI}\}$ a mono-source nor has the dependency a representation within the model. A well-formulated and fully factored model for this situation was described previously in 
figure \ref{pickexample}.
