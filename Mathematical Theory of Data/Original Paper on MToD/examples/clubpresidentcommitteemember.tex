\caption{Club president example. 
This example fails clause (i) of the definition of well-formedness because
the set of paths $\set{\tuple{I_0,yr1},\tuple{I_0,I_1,mNo}, \tuple{I_0,I_1,M,cId}, \tuple{yr}}$ is 
an identiofying set of paths wrt $p$ but is not minimum because a club has at most one president a year and sothe subset $\set{\tuple{I_0,yr1}, \tuple{I_0,I_1,M,cId}, \tuple{yr}}$ is jointly monomorphic. 
This problem can be fixed by introducing a clum membership relationship $R: p \morph c$ which is equivalent to
path $\tuple{I_0,I_1,M}$ and by specifying $R$ in place of $I_0$ which is to be combined with $yr$ to identify entitites of type $p$.
