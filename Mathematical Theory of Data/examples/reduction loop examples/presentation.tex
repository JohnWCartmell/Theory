%% Which is to say types as they are used in practice in software development and as represented in theory in categories and in syntactic type theories.
%% There is also a subplot concerning representation of context which certain types depend on -- again represented in practice and in theory.

I am struggling to prove my main theorem and so look for a counter example.
I wrote this on a white board yesterday

\slide[\footnotesize Suppose we reinstate relationship-like clause in definition of well-formulated then we wouldn't have a counterexample because
this model wouldn't be well-formulated. Therefore consider here (a different model) what if $r \circ s$ is relationship-like i.e. if $s$ is identifying-like.]{110}
\slide[How can we fix the original model though? Not be adding x for example]{120}
\slide[\footnotesize We can fix the original model by moving attributes $x_1$ and $x_2$ to entity type $b$. Seems a bit strange because moving to a more general type $b$ from a more specific type $a$.
Just a hint here that further conditions might come along one day to reduce duplication in such $x_i$, $s_i$.]
