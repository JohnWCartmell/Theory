This is a variation of the preliminary model in which each person may only be selected by a single other individual.
A person may select themselves in which case the person will be in a team of their own. 

In this example the schema is as shown in the earlier figure \lref{teamselectionpreliminaryschema}. 
In this model the fd factoring property holds because functional dependency $\msfd{S}{c}$ is now intransitive because though
$S \morph S\S \morph c$ we also have $S/S \morph S$.

The relations in relational schema  determined by $\chi$ is as shown above (where exactly) 
but now there is a functional dependency $S \morph pId$ and $S/pId$ is a candidate key. As predicted by 
theorem \lref{goaltheorem} this schema in BCNF. 

What I have written in notebook regarding constrained version of this example is that
whenever $p \circ x \simeq x$ then $p$ factors through a mono-source i.e. is identical to or equivalent to 
$I \circ p'$ for some path $p'$ where $I$ is a mono source. This coming about remember because we are trying to prove lemma 
%freeofdesignredundancyimpliesfdlhsismonosource 
\lref{freeofdesignredundancyimpliesfdlhsismonosource}.
