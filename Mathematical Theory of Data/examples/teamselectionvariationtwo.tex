This is a second variation of the preliminary model - the situation is as for variation one in that  each person may only be selected by a single other individual and a person may select themselves in which case the person will be in a team of their own but persons may elect not to participate in which case
in defining instances $E$, the relationship $s$ and the attribute $c$ are both undefined.


\begin{enumerate}
\item
A person may not select a person who has eleccted out 
Now the fd factoring property does hold because though we have $S \morph S/S \morph S/S/S ... \morph c$ 
we do have $... S/S/S \morph S/S \morph S$.
\item
a person may select a person who has elected out
now we do not have $S/S \morph S$ but then neither do we have $S \morph S/S$ or $S/S \morph S/S/S$ or so on and so we do have the fd factoring property.
\end{enumerate}
