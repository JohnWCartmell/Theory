"Aspects of a Mathematical Theory of Data"

I will discuss significant aspects of a theory of data and what may be achieved by representing data specifications as  sketches of Range Categories with additional structure. I will discuss the distinction between relational and non-relational physical data specifications and contrast physical and logical data specifications. I will discuss goodness criteria for such specifications and define some specific criteria which generalise the classic relational goodness criteria i.e. the so called normal forms of Codd, Fagin, Ling and Goh and others.

My goal for a fully elaborated Mathematical Theory of Data is to effect a change in what is considered best practice for the way in which data is specified and programmed as as to enable best practice to be shifted from being at the level that data is physically represented and communicated to being at the more abstract level of its logical structure.
