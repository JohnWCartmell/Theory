### 17 June 2022
I put this presentation together for a seminar to be given on 17 June 2022 at University of Birmingham.
Sadly this had to be scotched due to my (and Alison's) catching of COVID.
### 15 August 2022 
I placed the June version on ResearchGate as a baseline. 
I removed some slides that give background to theory of relational model.
As at 18th November 2025 this is not on Research Gate.
### Error:
There is a rogue slide that says: A data specification is an RR.5 range category, with finite restruction product, designated monomorphisms with partial inverse, an object v.
### Summary
For each of 
categories, categories with designated monomorphisms and epimorphisms, same with finite products
define appropriate notions of representational completeness, explore maximal constrainedness.

Define BCNF abstractly wrt requirement $R_C$.

First covers ground of the prepartion for a MToD paper.
Defines \textit{finatary property}
open question:  can the representation lemmas be changed to say have tyhe finatary property instead of locally finite? 

### Possible Error
In proof of sublemma regarding extending mono preserving functor to mono and epi preserving functor. Extend $F$ to $F_S$... \textit{how?}

### Blank slides in error I think. 
Representation for FDs Part One
Representation for FDs Part Two

### Missing definition
doubly maximally constrained

### Minor error
Slide Goodness Criteria 1F. Need to say that $f$ should be distinct from each of $p1$,...$p_n$. 

### Final result
If S is a sketch for a category C with designated mono-sources,
epi-mono factorisations and finite products and that S is considered
as a data specification with requirement RC , then if S is simple and C
is appropriately finite then S as data specification with requirement
RC meets the abstract BCNF criteria.

### January/February 2024
This is a presentation that I gave online to the Topos Institute.

### Summary
Gives an acount based on range categories. 
Gives good acount of relational and hierarchical and logical. 
Good account of logical to relational and vice-versa. upto this point could stand alone.
Gives good account of representation completenesses: equaltional, functional, inclusion.
Claims that these comleteness criteria imply BCNF or TNF. Have we proved this anywhere?
This would be most significant if I could write up this proof.
Describes the goal of proving that these representational completenesses follow from principles of no redundancy plus maximal contarinededness. I have had problems finding conditions in which to prove this. This has probably held me back. Maybe should focus on writing up the earlier material. 
### Way to go. 

### Possible Error
slide Referential Inclusion Dependencies as Range identities I say "in Par" (twice) is that correct? I feel that it should say in C(S).
### Lack of clarity
Slide Example --- Transform Relational Sketch to Logical Sketch. Step 3. What feature is mandating the addition of commutative diagrams? It is that column on lhs is derived so add commuting diagram instead of eliminating. In effect if simple column of lhs then add commuting digram and then eliminates but needt spell this out so just eliminate.
### Possible Error
Also possible error on this step 3  the second d in firxt inclusion dependency should be a d prime? THIS ERROR OCCURS TWICE IN THE STEP.
### Lack of clarity
Slide Example --- Transform Relational Sketch to Logical Sketch. Step 4. What feature is mandating the addition of commutative diagrams? This time it is the rhs which is non-trivial.

### 3 March 2025
Prepared for discussion with Ferrie.
Comprises the introductory slides from MoTD.lite and then a bunch of quotes regarding universals and particulars.
