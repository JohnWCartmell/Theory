Title: Mathematical Theory of Data-- Generic Goodness Criteria for Data Specifications

Abstract
I will explore the relationship between sketches of categories with additional structure and data specifications. I will propose and elaborate  generic goodness criteria for sketches of categories as data specifications and will show how with a following wind the classic relational database normal forms 
of 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF and IN-NF follow as special cases of the generic criteria.
