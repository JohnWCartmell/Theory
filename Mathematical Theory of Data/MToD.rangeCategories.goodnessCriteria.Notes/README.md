# Goodness Criteria for Data Specifications as Sketches of Range Categories

A follow up to this paper was the presentation given to the Topos Institute and found in MToD.ToposInstitute.slides.presentation.tex.
That follow up contained different material which needs writing up separately. 

Here we do not have an object or objects representing types all of whose instances are universals. 

## Some Issues as at  November 2025

### Not Substantiated
I claim a counter example to the suggestion that every range category can be faithfully embedded in a range category with splittings. There is atypo I shoudd say that g and h are distinct but in actual fact I do not substantiate this --- I do not show that $g \neq h$ in the given range category. I need to enumerate all the morphisms of the category and show that all the axioms of range categories hold. More importantly we havn't shown that if $f_s$ is added then $g=h$. This is surely not true. It would be trye if f was an epimorphism but then the splitting wouldn't be required. The remaining case of interest would be if $\hat{f} = id_b$ --- then what. This is very confused but if what I had in mind at the time is an f_s such that $ff_s \circ f =id b$ then it makes some kind of sense... ut it still isnt a counter example. I seem to mix something up and think that morphisms with a splitting are epimorphisms. This is not the case.

### No mention of RR.5.
If range category satisfied RR.5 the $f hat =id$ implies f is an epimorphism.

### Typo Lemma 5.1
HomP should be HomP(a,-).

### Split assumption --- I wonder
a few things. 
1. Can we forget about _ and ^ for a minute. Axiomatise f_s. We will just plufg in the axioms for range categories because  f_s \circ f = f bar and f hat and f \circ f_s = f bar. I guess we would have to show that if there exists a splitting then it is unique.
2. What is the splitting of a splitting. Do we know that {f_s}_s=f?.
3. Having said this ths f_s are not semantic. So don't want to assume them actually. Just want to use them to get homP to be a range functor. Does this make any kind of sense?



### feeling
I feel that I want everything to be tru in the range catgory as could be deduced from assuming every morphism is split. But I do not want the splitting. How interesting. FRom this perspective I want RR.5 because it follows from the split assumption.
### Disconnect 
Range^+ has partial sections. What are these? Definition seems to be covering the fact that we dont know when an embedding is faithful or not.

### MToD defintion
Now we have mention of RR.5.

### Lemma 7.2
It is looking here that split means partial sections. We use lemma 5.1 which also requires every morphism to be split.

### Ugly bit
We need a type v in gamma-structured category and instances map vc to V. How dows this work with Hom functors?
