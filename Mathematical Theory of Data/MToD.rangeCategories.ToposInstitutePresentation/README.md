### January/February 2024
This is a presentation that I gave online to the Topos Institute.

### Summary
Gives an acount based on range categories. 
Gives good acount of relational and hierarchical and logical. 
Good account of logical to relational and vice-versa. upto this point could stand alone.
Gives good account of representation completenesses: equaltional, functional, inclusion.
Claims that these comleteness criteria imply BCNF or TNF. Have we proved this anywhere?
This would be most significant if I could write up this proof.
Describes the goal of proving that these representational completenesses follow from principles of no redundancy plus maximal contarinededness. I have had problems finding conditions in which to prove this. This has probably held me back. Maybe should focus on writing up the earlier material. 
### Way to go. 

### Possible Error
slide Referential Inclusion Dependencies as Range identities I say "in Par" (twice) is that correct? I feel that it should say in C(S).
### Lack of clarity
Slide Example --- Transform Relational Sketch to Logical Sketch. Step 3. What feature is mandating the addition of commutative diagrams? It is that column on lhs is derived so add commuting diagram instead of eliminating. In effect if simple column of lhs then add commuting digram and then eliminates but needt spell this out so just eliminate.
### Possible Error
Also possible error on this step 3  the second d in firxt inclusion dependency should be a d prime? THIS ERROR OCCURS TWICE IN THE STEP.
### Lack of clarity
Slide Example --- Transform Relational Sketch to Logical Sketch. Step 4. What feature is mandating the addition of commutative diagrams? This time it is the rhs which is non-trivial.

Prepared for discussion with Ferrie.
Comprises the introductory slides from MoTD.lite and then a bunch of quotes regarding universals and particulars.
