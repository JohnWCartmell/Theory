# Data Specifications as Catgeories with Designated Monos and Epis

This is an old approach to data specification. 

This approach is overtaken by work on Range Catgeories as data specifications. 

I produced this presentation to give to the group at Birmingham...but had to abandon.

Range catgeories are more promising because they don't require objects in the generated category other than those present already in the sketch. Hmmm... this argument is questionable because of product objects.

### 17 June 2022
I put this presentation together for a seminar to be given on 17 June 2022 at University of Birmingham.
Sadly this had to be scotched due to my (and Alison's) catching of COVID.
### 15 August 2022 
I placed the June version on ResearchGate as a baseline. 
I removed some slides that give background to theory of relational model.
As at 18th November 2025 this is not on Research Gate.
### Error:
There is a rogue slide that says: A data specification is an RR.5 range category, with finite restruction product, designated monomorphisms with partial inverse, an object v.
### Summary
For each of 
categories, categories with designated monomorphisms and epimorphisms, same with finite products
define appropriate notions of representational completeness, explore maximal constrainedness.

Define BCNF abstractly wrt requirement $R_C$.

First covers ground of the prepartion for a MToD paper.
Defines \textit{finatary property}
open question:  can the representation lemmas be changed to say have tyhe finatary property instead of locally finite? 

### Possible Error
In proof of sublemma regarding extending mono preserving functor to mono and epi preserving functor. Extend $F$ to $F_S$... \textit{how?}

### Blank slides in error I think. 
Representation for FDs Part One
Representation for FDs Part Two

### Missing definition
doubly maximally constrained

### Minor error
Slide Goodness Criteria 1F. Need to say that $f$ should be distinct from each of $p1$,...$p_n$. 

### Final result
If S is a sketch for a category C with designated mono-sources,
epi-mono factorisations and finite products and that S is considered
as a data specification with requirement RC , then if S is simple and C
is appropriately finite then S as data specification with requirement
RC meets the abstract BCNF criteria.
