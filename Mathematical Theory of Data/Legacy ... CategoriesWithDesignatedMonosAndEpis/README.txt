This is an old approach to data specification. 

This approach is overtaken by work on Range Catgeories as data specifications. 

I produced this presentation to give to the group at Birmingham...but had to abandon.

Range catgeories are more promising because they don't require objects in the generated category other than those present already in the sketch. Hmmm... this argument is questionable because of product objects.
