\title{Regarding Categories with families (cwf)}


\author{John Cartmell}


\note It seems to me that in the syntax of gats, \textit{types and terms} on the one hand and \textit{contexts and realisations} on the other are each mutually dependent. In the world 
of syntax neither can exist without the other.

\note The theory \textit{meta-gat} (\cite{Cartmell14B}) algebraically describes the substitution structure of equivalence classes of types and terms of a gat. Meta-gat algebras have been described by Vladimir as B-systems and have also been described by Richard Garner (\cite{Garner15}) as algebras of a monad over a functor category.  We can summarise (at a stetch) by saying that ontologising types and terms yields meta-gat algebras also known as B-systems:

\begin{center}
$
\begin{array}{ c p{0.5cm} c}
\etype{\Rnode{TandT}{types\ and\ terms}} & & \attrtype{\Rnode{metagat}{\mbox{\textit{meta-gat = B-system}}}}
\end{array}

\end{center}

We can formalise this connection by showing that the category of generalised algebrauic theories 
is equivalent to the category of meta-gat algebras.  I wrote out the details of this proof in aproximately 1977 in the draft thesis I mentioned previously. The proof just involves a lot of leg work. The theory meta-gat is generalised algebraic.
 
\note The theory of \textit{contextual catagories} algebraically describes the substitution structure of equivalence classes of contexts and realisations of a gat. Vladimir has called  these C-systems. In this case we can summarise by saying that ontologising contexts and realisations yields contextual categories also known as C-systems:

\begin{center}
$
\begin{array}{ c p{0.5cm} c}
\etype{\Rnode{CandR}{contexts\ and\ realisations}}   & & \attrtype{\Rnode{concat}{\mbox{\textit{contextual category = C-system}}}}
\end{array}                     
$
\setlength{\arrnodesepA}{7pt}
\setlength{\arrnodesepB}{7pt}
\ncarr{CandR}{concat} 
\end{center}

This statement is formalised by showing that the category of generalised algebraic theories 
is equivalent to the category of contextual categories. This proof is written up in detail
in my thesis. The theory of contextual categories is generalised algebraic as shown by Vladimir
(\cite{Cartmell2018A}). 
I missed this in my work. 

\note
From the above it follows that the category of meta-gat algebras and the category of contextual categories are equivalent. I have worked from time to time on equational rewrite systems and, since retirement, I spent a good deal of time trying to write some software to do most of the leg work of such a proof by coming up with a rewrite system for the theory of contextual categories. In the end I gave up on it (which, by the way, doesn't mean to say that such a rewrite system cannot be be developed  -- it is just that the way that I was trying to do it just got too complicated). 

\note 
There is another equivalent structure that I think exists and that I have worked on from time to time without ever bottoming out. In my most recent work toward this I have called these
structures \textit{dependency categories} though realising now that Vladimir wouldn't like me calling them categories and might prefer a name like D-systems. I first described something along these lines in a conference paper in 1986 (\cite{Cartmell86B}). That paper was badly flawed in fact but the sentiment remains.
